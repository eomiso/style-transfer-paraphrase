The confession is simply a riddle, which is just a half-answer.
Of course, my heart's love is really sweet for that daughter of Capulet.
And so my wife is my wife, and mine is on her, and so I have to submit to her, or I'll
We met, we made a promise, I beg you to go, but this I beg you to accept : to accept our marriage.
Good morning, dear Francis!
And now you're so fond of Rosalind, who has already been so dear to you, that
And then love doesn't really come from your heart, but from your eyes.
It's impossible to stop the sun from shining on your old ears, not even with your old ears.
And there's a stain on your cheek, the stain that doesn't go away yet.
If you're not yourself and the things you do are for Rosalind, you're with them, as I am.
Do you really wish you were?
Then you'll say : When men are weak, women can't fall.
You were in love with Rosaline for a long time.
That wasn't love, that was a pupil's love.
I'd do anything to bury my love.
Not in a grave, to bury the other one.
I pray you don't mind, but I thank you for your patience.
The other one didn't mean anything either.
He knew that's what was being read, that's how the story was put together.
Come, young fiddler, come, and with me, you can be my assistant.
So, we're off.
I'm standing still.
Wickedly and carefully.
They're going fast.
Where's that "Romeo" that the devil would have had you
Did he come home tonight?
He's not his father.
I spoke with his friend.
Because she is the same pale, hardened wench, that Rosaline, torments him, and she'll surely get him to go crazy, and kill himself
Here comes the letter from the father of the lady whom I've been telling you about, who says that she has been sent
A life of challenge, a life of struggle.
Answer me, Rome.
Every man who writes can answer a letter.
And what he dare do, he'll answer for himself, what he dared not do.
Alas, poor old Romeo!
Will he face Tybalt?
Why, what is this, Tybalt?
What's the matter?
He wouldn't be dry like a dried herring.
How do you fish with meat, meat, what's the name of the fish?
He's for the numbers that flow from Petrarch.
Good morning, good lady.
What did I do to you?
The ticket, sir, the token.
Isn't that possible?
No, I'm the polite one.
I'm as good a man as you are.
That's better than the best.
Good, sir.
You lie.
You don't know what you're about to do.
What, are you going to get caught up in these filthy dung?
Good sir, come to us.
I'll faint, my brain is going to go to hell.
Switch and lift, or throw it on the ground, or I'll send it flying.
I'm done if my brains go wild, you take more of your brains than I have in my head.
Was I at the goose farm?
When you weren't with me, you never took the time to give me your full attention.
I'll scratch your earlobe.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Your wit is sweet and bitter.
It's a wonderful sauce.
And what if the goose's good for a sweet goose?
Oh, that narrow wit stretched out its arms and stretched it from a narrow inch to a wide ell
I'm spreading the word "broad," which, when combined with the goose, you can ride far and wide a wide goose.
Why, if love isn't for love?
You're social now, so I'll socialize with you.
It's like you, now.
If you told the story, you'd be even bigger.
You were deceived, fool.
I have come to the whole story, and I intend to occupy the debate, and to tell you the whole truth.
Here are some of the equipment we've brought with us.
Two, two, hats and aprons.
Look, Peter!
Oh, shit!
You, Peter, dear Peter.
Good night, good men.
God bless you, sweetheart, you're doing well.
Doesn't it make sense?
And now I have to tell you, the finger of the bastard's head is already ringing.
Out there!
What a man you are!
Woman, God made himself, and that's all there is to it.
By your word, I am quite sure.
I ask, "What do you say, "Quoth he?
Gentlemen, can you tell me where I can find my love, Romeo?
He will be older than you have ever been, as long as you find young Romeo.
The name's the youngest, because it's so sad that the worst is coming to this.
You're telling me you mean well.
Yes, is that the worst?
Oh, I think I see it all right, all right, and I'll be damned for saying it
He'll eat him for dinner.
So!
What's the matter?
Will you come to your father's?
Come on, we'll go eat dinner, then we'll go back.
I'll follow you.
A gentleman, a nurse, who loves to hear himself talk, and then speaks more quickly than he will do in a month.
And he will tell me everything, I'll hit him, he would be better than me, and twenty of them would be better than him.
If I can't find it, I'll find someone who will.
That vile bastard!
I don't know one of his flirt-bearers.
I didn't mean to offend him.
Nobody ever used you in his pleasure.
I would have immediately put it down if I had my gun.
I'll take it as soon as I can, if I can avoid being distracted by the law and a good fight.
My things are so shaken up that I'm trembling before God, to tell you the truth.
A wild-eyed hag!
Please, doctor, tell your wife and mistress to come here.
I protest, dear sister, and I really want to know what she thinks.
Lord, Lord, she's going to be as happy as if she were a king.
What do you want to say to her, nurse?
You're not telling me.
I have also heard that the friar of Montpellier, the abbot of the monastery, ordered
Keep up this good work, sweetheart.
I'll go ahead and tell you what kind of cords my men with you are making as you climb the steps of the great temple of joy, in the secret night, where all my men sleep.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
I trust you, and don't take any more pains to take care of you.
Goodbye.
I'm honored to be your property.
For heaven's sake, good God!
Hey, sir, I'm getting a little confused!
What, my dear nurse, what do you say?
Is that the man's name a secret?
And "two men can't keep a secret " isn't that the saying you never heard him say
Give me my man's truth as steel.
My lord, my wife is as sweet as ever.
Well, I guess I'll go on board, but the nobleman in Paris will have a knife, but a man with a flintlock, and a frog, but a poor one,
I get angry sometimes and tell her Paris is the driving force.
I mean, if I'm talking to you as far as I can tell, she looks as pale as a copy of the Versal World, and when
Didn't you, nurse, tell me?
Oh, nigger, the name of the dog is Ah, nigger.
Come, lady, give me a good shake.
One thousand times, Peter!
Anonym!
Before the storm and before the attack.
The clock struck nine when I sent for the nurse.
Maybe she won't meet him.
That's not it.
Oh, it's too bad she's lame!
To keep thoughts in check, the herald of love should be in his thoughts, which are twice as fast as daylight beams, driven into
The sun is rising in the highest hill of the day, so it's three o'clock now, but she's not here yet.
I think she would move quickly like a ball with warm young blood running through it.
I would have her as my sweet love and hers as mine.
Young, old people, many pretend to be dead, slow, heavy, and weak as lead, and loud, loud,
Oh, God, it's here.
Did you meet him?
Get your man out of here.
Peter, stay by the gate.
Oh, sweet nurse, what a sad man I am.
If it's sad news, tell them cheerfully.
If you want to play music for me, you have to play it sourly.
I'm very strong.
I'll leave you for a bit.
Damn my bones!
And you would be my bones and say so.
You won't stay a minute?
I'm not breathing, are you sure I'm out of breath?
How do you breathe when you have a breath?
The delay in your communication makes up for that excuse you're sorry about.
Are you okay with this news?
I'll answer that.
Say one and let me know.
I like that.
And what does it mean to be virtuous or vengeful?
Good job, you've made a good choice.
You don't know how to choose a man.
Hello, Romeo!
Though he has a face like none of his men, yet he's good, and his mood is well-mannered, and his voice is loud, and his legs are strong, yet he's short, and his eyes are blue, though
This flower, it's not a flower, but a lamb that is so gentle it's not
Go, take your time, madam.
To God.
How, did you eat at home?
No, no, no.
I knew it already.
What are we doing, celebrating our marriage?
What about that?
My back is against the other side.
Oh, back, back!
I'm sorry you had a bad time.
My dearest love, what does my love mean?
You say, like a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman,
Where's my mother?
It's all right.
Where's she?
How strange you're trying to react to that!
You're trying to be a gentleman, as a real gentleman would, "Where's your mother?" And as you
Oh, dear gods, is she so hot?
Marry, I'm here, come on.
Do you want to cut out my poultice of flesh?
Then your own messages will be on your own.
This is such a coil.
Come, what's the word, old man?
Are you going to go up to the shrift today?
I'm going to take you.
So you'll stay at the cell of Reverend Lawrence.
For your wife, you're staying with him.
There's bloody blood in your face.
And any news in red will be better than none.
You're going to church today.
I should grab the ladder, so you can reach the top of the dark cave, where I should place the bird's nest
Get
I'll have lunch.
You're going to be put in prison.
I'm just keeping the peace.
Stand up, or the sword will cut my flesh and blood.
What about that drawing and the peace talk?
The word is nauseating to me, as it's nauseating to hell.
Behave with you, you rascal!
The club, the bill, the leader!
Attack!
He's down!
With the Wamphyri!
Against Montagues!
What kind of noise is that?
My sword!
A man from Montague, with his sword at his side.
You villain, Capulet!
Don't try to find your enemy on your foot.
There's a high fortune for me!
Gentlewoman, go away.
Amen.
And in the short instant I've been in her sight, however brief, she can not be countered by joy that will be fleeting in my eyes.
Therefore, love is moderately loving.
Love is so long-lasting.
If he's too slow, he'll get too late.
Let me see the lady.
Oh, no one can wear a light foot.
Even for the spirit of my former priest.
For us both, Rome, thank you.
Otherwise, he'd thank him too much.
You, if you love your joy as mine does, and that your knowledge is more, the comforting air, and your taste will reveal the longing of the imagined joy of your friend, If you love yourself
Cheerful, more matter than words, he claims to have a substance, not ornament, like a crown.
We'll accompany you, and come right away.
Please, good mercutio, let's go.
These are men who, when they're at a tavern, clap you on the back and say, "God, no need!" These are men who, when they
Does this make me a friend?
I'll get you out of here, as hot as the Italian jack, and as quickly as the Italian jack is hot, and as quickly as he gets hot, and if
What's going on?
No, it would have been better for us to have had only one of them, one of them would have killed
You, why, you're fighting someone with a beard or a beard that's more or less like yours.
You, who are fighting a man who's going to throw a nut on you, don't have hazel eyes to give you reason to run away.
Would such a dispute be visible only to such an eye-catching look?
Your head is full of arguments as an egg, yet your heart is as well as a mouse as an egg.
He was a man on the street coughing because his dog, who had snoozed in the bushes, had w
Are you missing your tailor?
With another, if he'll tie the old ribbon with the new one?
But you can teach me to fight!
The bill should be sold for an hour and a quarter at my old rate of profit, and every man should buy it
Is this a simple fee?
Just go in there and put on some rags.
I have to climb to the top of the head.
No, my heel doesn't matter.
Add something.
Give me your word and your shot.
If you want to, sir, you can have me.
Are you not willing to give some occasion to someone?
Mercutius, you and I are with this boy.
What, do you want us to be minstrels?
Go, then, and find the music, so we can sing along.
We speak of the people in the public square.
Go to a private place, or you'll have reason to be cold.
We're so far away from home.
They were watching.
I won't move, not for anyone's pleasure.
Well, gentlemen, take your time.
Now I have to go with my man.
But if you put on your livery, I'll hang.
Doth me no great shame that I should have to be so fond of thee.
I'm a villain, no one.
That's right, then, farewell.
I know you don't know me.
I can't excuse the damage you've caused to me.
You have to turn and follow me.
Oh, good capulet, as much as I'd like to give you, because I know how much you're worth.
Calm, dirty, filthy, dishonorable!
What would you have me do?
Will you cut the hilt from the foreman's sword?
Quick, don't delay in speaking to me again until it's over.
I'm with you, I'm with you.
Humble merciful Signior Benedick, raise your sword.
There's a little bit of Tybalt out there.
I'm hurt.
A plague in both houses!
I'm going faster.
Has he disappeared and is not there anything?
What, is it bothering you?
Marriage, that's enough.
Where is my page, evil, get a surgeon.
That's bravery, man.
There's no way this injury could be so bad.
It's not as deep as a house, nor as wide as a church door, but it's enough, 'cause it's here.
I'll be buried tomorrow.
I know they're still peppered, sir.
There's a plague in both houses!
Nonsense, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a rat, a cat!
A cunning, rogue, a murderer fighting on the board!
Why did you come between us?
I'm hurt in your hand.
Well, I thought that would be best.
Let me in, noble lord, or let me go.
The plague in both your houses!
They turn me into worms for turning me into meat.
I do too, and I'm equally good.
You have a house!
Romione, Romeo, you're dead!
The wild Tybalt returns.
With victory, and the destruction of that villainous villain, mercutio
Either way, we'll follow him.
You, wretched boy, that's what he did to him.
The context will determine this.
Romeo, go, leave me!
The citizens have risen, and Tybalt's been murdered.
Don't be surprised.
If you take it, the Prince will destroy you, if you take it.
So, my friend, if you must leave, please, go!
Why don't you go?
And did he kill mercutio in the other direction?
Tybalt, the murderer who fled?
There he is, that old Tybalt.
Tell him, nephew.
When?
Where did the bad guys come from from?
I'll go find all the miserable warriors who've got fatal battles.
Your brother, brave Mercutio, killed your cousin, young Romeo.
Tubal, my cousin!
Oh, for my brother's babies!
Welcome, my cousin!
Who started this bloody fight, Benedick?
He yelled, "Hold on, friends! " and then laughed.
The fatal blow struck his fatal point, and "twixt them, he ran with his own arm, and "twixt them" hurled the deadly strike.
But though he was a man of his own time, a man who was taken aback by sudden return to revenge, and to have gone like lightning after being banished from the world
Romeo's turned and flies as he fell.
It's true, or the world will end.
He's not telling the truth.
There were twenty of them, each of them killing one of us.
I beg you, do this for me, and do it quickly.
Tyranny's finished with Tybalt.
Romeo's not going to live.
Mercutius and Romeo have been killed.
Who pays for my blood?
His fault is that he ended up where he did, with what he should have ended, that of a young Tybalt
I want to hear your heart's thoughts.
But, good Lord, let me get you so strong that all your proud fears will be put to the test
I've made a fool of myself, and now I'm deafening myself
You can't beat abuse with abuse, no matter how many tears you shed, how many prayers you make, or
Then bear this body and obey our will.
But mercy, pardon those who have murdered them.
Their lovers are lovers, as lovers are lovers, and as such, they have visions of their own amorous rites, if they are blinded, it is best to agree with the
Oh, ladies, on the night of the Civil Night, that's the night that we all have to thank you for, on which all our hopes rested,
Oh, bloody black mantle, bright with my blood, and you lighten up my love with a moment like this, like I love it.
Wait, there's no need for a night!
Come, Romeo.
Come, fly on the wings of the night, like the night before the day of the winter.
I'll be dead when I die, the stars will fall, and the sky will be filled with lovely stars
What did he say you'd pick up the cords for?
I'm sorry, but these cords are the key.
Oh, what's the news?
Why are you holding your hands up?
Oh, noble sir!
We must go, girl!
Alas, this day is not the day for
Is there any heaven in heaven that isn't filled with jealousy
Romeo's going to do it, though the heavens forbid.
What devil's name is that?
Torture must be so terrifying that it breaks the will of

Well, I'll tell you this : "Oh, I'm telling you, " because I know that the death-dealing crow of the cockatrice is less
I can't do that if he kills him, and if not, "no." I'll have to wean him of that false pride.
Prison, you don't see freedom, not even for your eyes.
A dirty land to the earth's end.
My best friend, Tybalt, you and I!
If I lived, I'd be dead.
Did Romeo kill Tybalt and is he dead?
My cousin and my brother-in-law?
And now Tybalt's gone, and Romeo is gone.
Oh, noble Lord, have I done it, that my hand has bled to death from the
He did, he did.
Indeed, this day is the occasion of our misfortune.
Oh, a serpent's heart lies hidden in a shiny face!
Did the dragon ever have such a sweet cave to lie in?
A raven with a raven, a wolf in its wings!

I'm old, I have the pains, the pains, the anguish, the sorrows, the sorrows,
Oh, my God, shame on this rotten wretch!
If such a wish were granted, you would have a burned tongue for making it!
He didn't grow up to be a shameful man.
On his brow there's shame, disgraced to sit in the highest honor.
I couldn't be offended by the universal earth, for I was such a monster!
Are you going to tell him to kill your cousin?
Well, but where did you kill my cousin?
I would have killed my cousin for this.
Everything comforted me.
Why weep then?
Oh, that would make me forget, but I wish I'd forgotten it as a sin of a guilty man.
And now, here comes Tybalt, dead and buried.
It killed ten thousand kabbalists and "punished" the word "shamed" with "the punishment of ten thousand
The death of Tybalt was a great tragedy.
She said, "Tybalt's dead, " and "My father, or your mother." "Folk,
Father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all dead, all dead.
The word's death has no end, no limit, measure, bound, in that word's demise.
The woe of words can't describe it.
Where are my father and mother?
And we have been crying and wailing on Tybalt's neck ever since.
Are you going to them?
I'll go get you some food.
You want to wash his wounds with tears?
Mine's spent when they dry up, and that's when Romeo is exiled.
Poor ropes, you scaring me, and I won't marry you, either.
I'm off to bed, but you, my daughter, are my mother's death.
Death, not that kind of death, you head of my lady's!
Go to the chamber.
I'll go get you for your lover, Romeo.
I know where he is.
Your Romeo will be there at night.
I'll be his escort.
He's hidden in Lawrence's cell.
Come on, come on, Romeo!
Come in, you wretch.
What's the news, father, son?
My dear son, you know such a sour company.
I've just heard the news of the Prince's death.
What's the Prince's doom to the other princes?
Oh, hell, banishment!
Death is more terrifying than death itself, which is more terrifying than death itself.
Banishing" is not to be said, so you'll be released.
Wait, the world is wide and deep.
There's no heaven without Veron, torture, hell.
Therefore, " banished " is lost in the world and its exile is death.
You scold me for being too lenient with you, " Banishing death, Death is the best.
Oh, there's fatal sin in this!
Oh, you're rude to me!
This is torture and not mercy.
More legitimacy, more respectability, more potential.
He can fly, but I have to fly.
They're free, but I'm banished.
Do you still not understand that exile is not death?
No poison, no sharp knife, no sudden death, but "Banished" to kill me?
Friar, the word's not hell full of torment.
Howling now.
And to what heart, being a divine, a ghostly lover, a sin-defender, and my friend confessing to me that she loves me and
Oh, you're very sweet, don't you hear me?
But to your enemies, whom you, as I approach, have been servants of.
I just took a part in them.
We began to exchange blows and thrusts, while the prince came in and out of the ring, part and part, and we began to fight.
Oh, where's my sweet prince?
Did you see him today?
Well, I'm glad I didn't take part in that fight.
I knew him and knew his secret.
Many people have seen him on the morning of the new day, with the clouds filling the morning dew with tears.
But as soon as the sun goes up in the eastern direction, and the dark curtain of Aurora's bed is lifted, the sun's warmth goes out of my body.
You're going to have a talk about the banishment again.
Don't talk any more.
So, I'm sure there's no ears for crazy people.
And how should they, if the wise men don't see?
With my own, I challenge your estate to a duel.
You can't talk about it, you don't feel it.
Maybe you can talk to her, but you can't talk to her as much as I loved, an hour's marriage, like mine, and like me, like you'll be lost, and you'll be ruined, and that will be the

One hit.
Oh, good Romeo, hide behind the bushes.

Who's so tough to knock?
Where is your name?
What's your purpose?
God, where's my lady's lord?
Where's Romeo?
Oh, mistress, even in the case of this poor man.
Oh, heartbroken sympathy, you devil!
Still, she, with her hands up and her eyes shut, crying and crying.
Wait, you're going to be a man.
Please, go, for her sake.
Why should I sink so deep?
doctor?
Oh, my lord!
Death is the end of everything.
Did Juliet say you wished you were there?
What's going on?
Where is he?
What's going on with her?
What's the love of an abandoned woman to a wedding?
It was as if he had killed his own name, shot from the deadly point of a deadly weapon, that he murdered his brother, leaving him to die
Doth my name to be Doth, a dreadful part of the anatomy, friar?
Tell me, will you get me a nasty house?
Are you a man?
The wild acts really are monstrous, a beast of rage.
You've surprised me, sir.
I thought of your attitude better than that.
Did you kill Tybalt?
Why did you come to birth?
And as a maker, like a farmer, you put us to bed, your love, your wit, and that's all right, like a trader, there's nothing to do with it, really nothing to do with it, that's what's best
What, you're actually pissed, man!
Julia, for whom you are now dead, is alive, for your dear sake.
But Tyrbalt will kill you, though you're fine.
You have become a friend of death and exile, and so you can depart.
Your back is your best garment, happiness is your greatest comfort, and with the blessing of heaven on your

Come, come, you who are on your way to love, as they say.
Go away and comfort her in her room.
I'll tell my lady to hurry up, and I'll help her house get ready for her big sorrow.
Romeo's coming soon.
Oh, for God's sake, I'd stay here all night to hear good advice.
What learning!
Then bid my dear defend.
Here's a ring I want to give you, sir.
Come, hurry up, and let's go out into the night.
How nice it is that my comfort is restored!
So go.
Good night, all right, good night.
Or you'll appear before the clock is set, or the day of the day is concealed, or the hour of the day is eclips
Sojourn in Pardo.
I'll meet you at the gate, and I'll see if he gives you a good experience.
With all my heart, keep your hand here.
That's too late.
Goodbye, farewell, goodbye.
We've had a lot to fall on, sir, so we couldn't move her.
You know, she really loved her cousin Tybalt, and I loved her very much.
Well, we were born to die.
We're not in the mood to woo these times.
Madam, good night.
I have to go to your daughter.
I will and I'll know her in the morning.
She's pretty heavy tonight.
Let me make a desperate appeal for my little one.
But then I'll be at my son's house with him, and you'll see me, but very nice!
What day is it?
My lord Monday delivered my message.
We're in the air Monday morning.
Oh, wow!
Is it too fast?
We won't be as big, a friend or two, but not as bad
And if we have any lot of fun, that may be thought to be too young, if we're too young for our job.
And then we'll have friends, and then we'll be done.
But what would you say to Thursday?
My lord, I wish I were here on Thursday.
Go ahead, then.
You'll meet me at Juliet's.
Come with us?
It's not the best time yet.
There was no feathery lark, but a quiet ghost of yours that you had to deal with in the evenings.
Love, what envious streaks of the sky in the other east flatter the sun.
The dark moon lights up the valleys and hills with its candle-burning jocund day, breaking up the day into the night.
I know it's not daylight, but it's the same light that it's been in the
Tonight a meteorite will burn your path to Mantua, shining as a torch to your path to Mantua.
So stay, I'll leave the last.
You shouldn't be here.
I'll be here.
I'm going to die.
Fine, then, give it to me.
I'm more worried about staying in this house than I am going to a fight
Death, welcome to death!
Let's talk about it.
It's not the day.
That's true, that's true.
It's a lark that's a little unruly, a harsh discords and a terrible noise.
Some say the lark will make a good division.
She's not so much, 'cause she's divided us.
And the light grows brighter and brighter.
More light and darkness, more darkness!
Madam!
doctor?
Your mother will come to see you.
The day is a day of darkness.
Go inside, and open the window.
Goodbye, farewell.
One kiss and I'll descend.
He's sitting in his own pen, shut the windows, locks the doors, and spends the night in the artificial night.
My noble uncle, what do you know?
I can't tell you what he thinks or whether he's honest or not.
Would you have me, sir, any means of removing him from the
Come, madam, let's go inside.
Love, sir, do you think so?
By the time I see my own dear Romeo again, I'll have lived longer than I could have dreamed
Goodbye!
I'll never have any of my talents to communicate with you, love, love.
Do you think we'll ever meet again?
For God's sake, my soul is ill-guarded.
You seem so low as if you were dead in the bottom of a grave.
Either I don't have eyes, or you look pale.
I'll tell you, love, you see in my eyes how I see you.
Our dry sadness is our blood.
Goodbye, goodbye!
The heavens are good, heavens are good!
Everyone's calling you a fool.
But if he's lucky enough to stay, keep him in your bag, but don't bother with him.
Who's calling me?
Is your lady's mother here?
What is her reason for coming here?
Julia, how are you, my love?
Madam, I'm not well.
Ever since your cousin died, have you been weeping for him?
What, will you give him a smile for tears?
You can't live it if you can't even get a glimpse of him
He did.
There's a lot of grief, but there's also a lot of love, but still a lot of pain.
Yet I would weep for such loss.
Then you'll feel the loss, but you won't feel so happy about your friend.
The loss is so great, that I can't choose between being sad and being happy.
You can't cry for his death like the death of a murderer, as he is alive.
What evil woman, madam?
The same villain, Rívio.
He's because the traitor survived.
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Oh, only have to kill my cousin!
So go cry no more.
And as for that banished duke, I'll have him sent for, where the same banished duke lives, and I'll give him a new mace to make him run after that
Then I'll bet on it.
No, I won't be satisfied until I see the dead Romeo, and my heart goes for a brother-in-law.
My dear madam, if you had only known a man to bear a fatal poison, I would calm him down, so that it would, when it had received them, sleep in peace.
He killed my cousin, my cousin's love, which killed him!
Then find the means and get him.
You'll be happy to hear, girl.
It brings out the best in us, such a time of need
What's that, my dear?
Well, well, you have a very kind father.
Madam, what's the day like today, what day is it?
The gallant, young, noble, and noble gentleman, parishioner of St Peter's, shall invite you to his home on the first of the week, and the good sir, the parish clerk,
By the holy Church and the holy Church, I won't be a wedding guest anymore.
I wonder how it will turn out, so I'll be Ere's husband, and I'll wonder how I'll do
I beg your pardon, madam, and father, I'm not married.
When I've finished, I swear it's not Paris, but that little French devil, who's
This is news!
Here comes your father.
If you want to speak with him privately, speak to him yourself and see what he does to you.
How are you?
A way to get a girl, sir?
What, even when I was crying out, he didn't wipe?
Have you given our decree to her?
I wish I could marry her to the grave!
What, will he not do it?
Isn't she proud of you?
Doth she not say she is a blessing, unworthy as she is, for her wedding day?
I'm not proud of you, but I'm glad you did.
How, how, how, how?
I did.
What's going on?
You may say " " and " " and " " " and " " " and " " " and " " and " " and " and " and " and "
From the green disease, from the corpse!
Oh, out, you naughty baggage!
Oh, you're about to burn your face off!
Oh, God!
What's so funny, you're so stupid?
Father, I beg you to listen, but I beg you to speak a word.
Don't speak to me.
You can't answer that question.
Don't answer me.
She's in the back, hilding!
May God bless this woman who gave you this!
You should rate her as high as you can, sir, so you should give her a good
And why, lady Wisdom?
Leave these gossips alone, and you'll be all right.
I didn't mean treason.
God bless you, sir.
And should they be silent, sir?
Peace, you villain!
And here we must be in the mouths of gossiping men for here we have to go
You're too hot.
The bread of God!
This is very crazy.
I care about her all day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, and most of all, I'm very concerned about her.
It's very near at hand.
Put your hand on your heart and tell me.
You are mine, and I will give you your own share.
Trust me, it will.
I won't swear by your name.
A month, a week, a month.
If you won't, make the bridal bed in the ancient monument where Tybalt lies, so you can rest your
Don't talk to me, I won't talk.
Just do what you want, and I'll do it with you.
What, are you saying I'm a devil?
My husband is lying on the ground and the heavens are spinning around him.
If my husband isn't sending me to Earth to return to heaven, then if the children aren't
It's all right.
Don't you want to tell me a little joy?
I'm comforted, nurse.
Oh, he's a really kind gentleman.
Romeo is a goat for you.
A woman, madam, as well as Paris, is not so quick, not so fair.
I know you're pleased with the second match, as you're a better match for the first.
You have to kill him first, or you'll die too.
Is it true you've been speaking from your heart?
Welcome to our club!
What's the matter?
You have really taken good care of me.
I'll go, tell my lady, I'm leaving, upset with my father, I'll go.
I'll do it, and it's wise.
That's a devil!
I'll seek out a friar to cure my sickness.
If there are no other men, then I'll die.
What, is that what you mean, Mr. Mayor?
It's very short for such a short time.
You're saying you don't know the lady.
I can't love it.
You know the reason for this haste.
Look, sir, here comes the lady who's coming to my cell.
I'm glad we met, good wife and mistress.
That's true, sir, when I'm a woman.
Good morning, sweet friend.
Is it the right time of day?
But the new number nine was found.
Did he go so fast to see me father?
Really.
They don't have that.
In love?
Up.
Love, love, and then give me your hand.
Where are you getting food?
There's "may be" Thursday, love.
What will be, is what is.
That's a bit of a note.
Are you going to confess your father?
I wish I could confess my sins to you.
You can't deny that I love you.
I'm sure I'll confess that I love him, for I know I'm going to get him
I bet you will, too, and that's the reason I'm so
If you wish to say what you want to say behind my back, I'll be more expensive to say it than to face
You're crying tears of joy.
You've stolen my face, and you've accused me of it.
My lord, we must hurry to a place where we can stay alone for a while.
God, I have to disturb your devotion, my love, Juliet.
Julia, I know you have a problem.
Now that Friday is fast approaching, nothing can be done to make things better.
If you can't tell me how to prevent it, friar, if you won't let me hear how to prevent it, I won't hear it.
Call me wise, and with the knife, I'll help you out of this bind, if you can't help yourself.
Wait!
We'll be here tomorrow at noon.
Look, you will stay alone tomorrow night.
Don't let the nurse get in your room.
No heat, no breath.
Get it, you!
I need strength to love.
Farewell, good father.
But sir, if they refuse to lick their fingers, I won't hurt them.
How dare you try them?
He can't have me if he can't kiss his fingers.
Go, go, go, go, go.
This time we'll be empty.
Oh, my dear lord.
Look at where she's coming from, grumpy.
Where I learned to confess the sin of disobedient obedience to you and your order, and to beg for your pardon, holy Lawrence enjoins me to stand upright.
Send your districtmen out.
Tell him what you got to tell him.
Tomorrow I'll tie the knot.
I was greeted by the young man of my youth, and, upon reflection, I found that I might not go out of the bounds of modesty, as I had before.
Why, good sir.
All right.
Stand up.
Now, Reverend holy man!
He is bound to the whole town.
Nurse, will you come to my closet to help me sort out what you want to do to me tomorrow, in case I forget to
No, until Thursday.
Enough time.
We're off to church tomorrow.
It's nearly night.
I know that everything will be all right, I promise you.
I'll help you out with your advice, and you can help her deck her.
I can't sleep tonight.
I must be alone.
Once I've played this woman for all the money I
Yes, those suits are the best.
What's the matter, madam?
Do you want me to help you?
Oh, but I can tell from your sudden absence that you have lost all your fingers.
Good night.
Goodbye, and thanks for all your advice.
In a miserable place like this, I must act alone.
Come, vial, let's get it.
What if it doesn't work with the mixture?
Will I marry tomorrow?
Lieutenant, lie here and lie there.
Ha!
I think my cousin's ghost is trying to find Romeo and spit him on a sword.
Stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, my dear, woo me, dear Romeo
Here's a drink.
I have to drink for you.
No, coz, I'd rather cry.
Heart, what is it?
It's like love breaking down.
What else could you say?
An abominable mutiny of silent-eyed, sickening gallows, and a preservation of tenderness.
Goodbye, madman.
Slight!
I'm going.
If you leave me, you're going to do something wrong.
Tut, I'm lost.
I didn't come, I didn't come.
Tell me, who are you in love with?
What, will you groan, or will you swear by your nose?
Screw you, damned scoundrel!
Well, no, but I have to
Actually, sir, I do not know, in fact, I'm sorry, but
Wait, nurse, take the keys and get some more spices.
They're calling for the date and plums.
Come on, take it easy, darling.
The second cock is laughing.
The bell has been ringing for a while.
Don't pay the cost.
Go, cuckoo, go.
Believe me, you're going to sleep.
You won't get to watch the play tomorrow, so you won't get sick.
I followed the smaller cause all night, and haven't been sick.
I'll watch you with such a watch, that you'll never be able to hurt me again.
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Wait, brother, what's the point?
Let's go, hurry, and bring me to him.
I go to the head, sir, and not trouble Peter at all.
It's just mass, and it's really nice.
A merry bastard, I tell you.
Are you going to be a loggerhead, old man?
Wife, what's going on?
What, what, are you kidding me?
Oh, dear, nurse, I'm telling you, oh, sweetheart!
Take Juliet to wake her up.
Go get it out of here.
Let me go to Paris and speak with her.
Hie, hurry up, hurry, hurry.
The groom is already here.
Go, tell me now.
Mama!
What's wrong with you, sweetheart?
Oh, Julie, he's quick, I swear.
What, lady?
What, you know, I'd say, love.
Mistress, madam!
Sweetie, honey, it's too bad.
Why, sweetheart?
What, no one says a word?
Now you can take your price tag.
How is it sleeping?
You'll be taken to the county bed.
I know he'll frighten you, but I can tell by his looks.
Is that possible?
What's that noise?
A very unfortunate day indeed, my dear lord.
What's going on?
Look!
What a big day this is!
Me, me!
Oh, my child, my only child, the sweetest of souls, the tender heart of the man, the joy of
I beg your pardon, but it's time that Juliet should be freed.
Her lord is coming with her.
She's dead, dead.
Besides, I haven't come today.
Already.
She's dead, dead!
What?
I want to see her.
Out, out!
It's cold out there.
Her cheeks are as heavy as their beds and her joints are as stiff as her boots
It's been a long time since I've been separated from my lips.
Death's like a sudden frost in the sweetest flower fields.
What a disgrace!
This is a horrible time.
Death, which has made me cry, Ties my tongue and will never be able to speak again.
And should the bride be at the altar?
We're ready, but we won't come back.
My son-in-law's death.
Death's my heir.
He has a daughter here in my house.
I'll die and leave him to his fate.
Oh, life, life, death, all of them die.
Is this really what I want to see tonight, and will this give me such a glimpse of his face?
Unhappy, unhappy, unhappy, unhappily day!
His journey lasted for the time that he was traveling, and his labor was only for the journey.
But, father, pity me, but one thing to comfort, and death of my eyes!
Ha!
Alas, unfortunate, unfortunate day!
I never saw anything so gloomy as this day has shown me.
Oh, a terrible day!
Brutal, divorced, sued, accused, insulted, killed!
The worst of Death, by you, that's what you've done to me, you hateful, cruel, devilish villain!
Oh, splendid!
Life!
Not life, but love for death.
Sad, shameful, wicked, dreadful, death!
Uncomfortable time, what are you going to do now?
I'm not just some child's soul!
Art thou dead?
Be calm, ho!
Confusion cured that, but not in the confusion.
You were involved in the fair maid's play.
The sky is all up in heaven now.
And the maid is the better for it, because the better for a
But heaven keeps him alive, as long as you're willing to part with it.
I should have advanced to your heaven, but she was your greatest wish.
So weep, because she'll go over the clouds, like the sky itself, into the clouds?
Oh, you love your baby so much that you're so far gone in love that you're making up stories about
She's not married, but she's the best wife to die young.
A set of knickknacks, the bride's wedding ring and the funeral feast of sorrows.
Oh, my gracious lord, these solemn and holy hymns have changed, the bridal flowers have no more to bury, and everything
Everyone is preparing to bring her to her grave.
The sky's against you because of a disease that's ruining your body.
We'll go, faith, we can pipe.
Yes, I would say that the case could be amended.
It wasn't a trap, let's play a little trick on them.
It's not the time for playing.
Then you won't?
No.
You'll get it from him pretty soon.
What's for us?
Not a penny, but the flash.
I'm going to make a minstrel of you.
So that I may serve you, so I can catch the creature you'll
Give me a dagger to serve the creature.
I won't make a crossbow.
Then come on, let me make my wit for you.
You want to answer me like men.
Come, sir, because silver is a pleasant sound.
What do you think, James Soundport?
But faith, I'm not sure what you're asking me to say.
I want to tell you something.
She's "a sound with a silver tone" as music is played with no gold in it.
What a nasty, vile creature!
Hang on, boy!
If I'm lucky enough to have the luck to dream of a happy news in my sleep, then I'll
Oh, what a god!
Love itself is a happy thing when it looks like a shadow of joy!
The news of Veron!
Didn't you write to me from the friar's house?
How is my lady?
Do you have my father?
What is the fare to Juliet's?
If she's healthy, I ask again, nothing bad can happen.
And that's all right, and nothing can be worse.
She sleeps in the Capel's tomb and her immortal soul lives on.
I saw her in the monastery, and now I'm here to tell you about it.
I'm sorry to hear this bad news, since you left me in my office to go to bed.
The sick man is sad, but he doesn't want to give in, so he'll beg for mercy.
Sadly, cousin, I'm very fond of a lady.
A pretty good shot!
I think I'm a good friend.
Fair price, fair price, fair price.
Well, you're going to miss this.
For beauty, starved for her severity, he cuts the beauty of all posterity, including her own.
It's too fair, too wise, too wise, too fair, to make me despair.
I'll rule you.
Forget about her.
Oh, I must forget everything!
So will this be so?
Then I'm afraid, my stars!
You know my room.
Send my paper and ink to me.
I'll go out tonight.
Please, sir, I beg you to be patient.
You look pale and wild and carry some of your own mistakes with you.
You were wrong, Fool.
Let me go and do what I asked you to do.
Is there any letter from the friar?
No, my lord, it's not what you think.
No matter.
Go, and hire a horse for the journey.
I'll be right back.
Come with me tonight, and I'll be with you tonight.
Let's see what the means are.
You'll quickly enter the minds of desperate people!
And the house was there, as I remember.
A beggar's shop is closed on holiday.
What, what, what?
Oh, my lord, what the hell is that!
Who's calling so loudly?
Come on, man, get up.
Oh, I see you're poor, aren't you?
Wait, there's forty ducats in the bag.
And he's full of despair, and he fears death?
Your cheeks are full of famine.
To have oppression and hunger is to be hungry.
The world doesn't belong to your friends.
There is no law in the world that can make you rich.
Take your food and bring it to Juliet's grave.
This is the holy friar's tomb!
Brother, he's going to be a great king!
This is Friar John calling.
Welcome to the New Jersey.
What's the point of this play?, What's this play about?,
Or, if he's writing his mind, give him a letter.
So that I'll have the opportunity to go to Mantua and find you.
Then who's going to give me a letter to woo that lovely maiden?
Unhappy thing.
Brother, let me go take you with me.
I have to go alone to the shrine.
I think she'll wake up in three hours.
But I'll write to Mantua, and keep it in my cell until I hear from him that he's arrived.
Poor life, they're shut in a tomb for a dead man!
You have a flashlight, boy.
Therefore, it is necessary to separate from this event.
But I'd rather not be seen, for I'm not going to be seen.
Take these flowers for me.
Go as I command you.
But I'll go on with my adventures.
The boy warns something coming.
What a cursed foot this way to the prom is that I'll get the love ritual of my true love wrapped up in this nightg
With a torch!
The night is quiet, so much of it.
Bring me the wrench and the iron.
I won't, my lord.
You'll have to prove your friendship by showing me your body.
Let's go then.
Good young man, don't tempt a desperate man.
Get out of here and leave me alone.
Think about what they've done to you.
You can't scare them away.
Young man, don't tempt me again with another sin.
O, let go!
Stay away from me, and don't come inside.
If you refuse to go, he'll call you a madman and beg you to flee.
I will not admit to a crime against you, and I will be put in prison.
Will you provoke me?
Come here, you jerk!
Oh, for God's sake, they're fighting!
I'll call the watch and come back.
The tomb is open.
This noble head of the Mercutius family, in the parish of Paris.
When my soul hasn't come to him when we've ridden together?
I'm sure he said that it would be better for him if she had married a gentleman
Didn't he say he didn't?
Maybe I just dreamed it?
I'll bury you in the grave of a triumphant man.
Caustic, is it?
No.
A lantern with a knife, cut a young man, his body covered with beauty, and he was already dead.
Your breath has sucked out your beauty, and your words have not yet reached their full potential.
You can't be defeated.
But, sir, what else can I do for you besides to cut your youth short?
I wish I were as superstitious as I am, and that the lovely monster, who is still holding me here to love him, was not only in love with me
Here, in your room, I'll stay with your maid.
And, in the name of all that is good in this world, and to secure the yoke of those hapless stars from the world of despair,
Let's have a last look at you.
Arm yourself, you've got the last kiss.
You have a fast drug.
So that I may die with a kiss.
That smiling mask, which would kiss a good woman's brow, makes us think of their concealment.
So, Francis, go fast!
What's going on in my feet?
Here's a friend, a friend who knows you well.
Thank you, very kindly!
What torch does your useless light lend to grubs and idiots?
I understand that the candle is burning in the tomb of the Capel.
Who is this?
Nice little town, Rome.
How long have you been here?
Half an hour ago.
Come on, let's go to the room.
I won't, my lord.
Halt!
I'll go alone.
I'm afraid of the situation.
Oh, God, what a terrible thing it is to be afraid of some horrible thing!
I dreamed I was under the tree, under my master and the other one, and that my master was dying.
Oh, dear, what's that bloody blood, what's that bloody stuff?
Come on, boy.
Where is my lord?
I have a good sense of where I should be.
Where is my Romeo?
I hear a noise.
Take the life of the wicked, who have come from the nest of death, contagion,
Hath has thwarted our ambition in greater force than we can stand.
Come, go, go.
Your husband is dead.
Come, let me bring you to the sisterhood of the holy nuns.
A cup, in which I would have drunk real love?
He drank, and the tears came out of his eyes, and he left no friend to help me
I'll kiss your lips.
I'm sure they're still there, so let me rest a bit with a restorative.
Yes, noise?
So I'll just say.
This is your dagger, this is your hilt.
I'm dying of rust and dying of it.
This is the place to be.
Here, where the torch is burning.
Look for graves, search for graves.
A horrid sight!
Here, here's the dead, the cold and the new dead who've just laid here two days ago.
Go to the head.
Let's rise up all of them to Montagu's.
He's looking for others.
Here's the man who married this lovely woman.
In the cemetery we were looking for him.
Please keep him safe until the Prince comes.
Here comes a priest trembling, coughing and crying.
The same day that he was serving at the side of the churchyard, we'd carried him off to a mine and used his shovel to
An awful suspicion.
Follow the friar on his way to the church.
What a mess we have made for the morning, what a delay in bringing our person to rest!
What is this, the way they scream abroad, threatening us with their wicked tongues?
The people who were on the streets shouted, "Romeo, " some Juliet, " and "Paris, " and all walked in with a roar.
Search, seek, and discover the foul deed.
Ha!
Look, how our daughter is bleeding!
He had a dagger, because, lo, he was without Montague's house, and he mistook in his daughter his mistress, who was pregnant.
It's my fault!
As my elderly aunt's ghost bell to warn me to stay indoors.
Alas, my lord, my wife's dead today.
I stopped breathing for my son's exile.
What do you mean, by that, that can't be against mine?
Look, and you'll see for yourself.
But until we can find out the reasons for these absurdities, until we can learn the head, the body, the true end of your fate, and then lead you to death, I will not stop you from
So far, no, and let the chances of being wrong keep the day on its way.
I am the greatest, I can do the least, yet I am the one most feared, yet I am the one most likely to kill me.
I'm standing here and I'm trying to turn my conscience into a weapon.
So tell me.
And my short-term breath is not so loud as to be tedious, for my short-term breath is not so long as
Meanwhile, on the shore of some island where there's some medicine that should stop the bleeding, Romeo, when he was a good night and the medicine should be
What are you doing?
The love they have, the death of her.
Montague.
My lord Montague, could I have your hand?
My lord, what about my suit?
But I said what I've already said.
The world is a stranger to my child.
She was never in a position to see the last fourteen years.
She's happy to do them, younger than they are.
Too late, too soon.
But do you, gentle Paris, give her a heart.
I'm hosting an old-fashioned feast tonight, and I invite many of my friends who I like, as well as many other men

What are these names?
The white ink on the lettering of the yard and the blue-and-yellow ink on the writing of the tailor's workshop tell me that
And I'm here to find out the names of those who have written here, and I won't find out the name of the person who wrote it.
Take a new infection, and the old one will die.
That's a good plantain leaf.
And what is so important to you?
Why do you want to be mad at Romeo?
Not crazy, but a madman, and I'm a man, he's got me in jail, I'm in prison, and he's punished, good sir.
For God's sake, I'm good.
My lord, can you read this?
In my misery, I am my own misfortune.
Maybe you've learned from books alone.
I beg your pardon, but can you find anything you've seen that might interest me?
Oh, I'll read the letters and speak the language.
You're telling me straight out.
Wait, you two.
I'll read that.
In the name of Queen Beatrice and her pretty nieces ; her sisters Beatrice, a fine nieces and a cousin of this gentleman, Countess de Caubert ; and her sweet and noble
And Mr. Valentino and his cousin Tybalta.
Who's going?
Farewell.
Where?
To dinner?
To our house.
Who's got the house?
My master!
I would ask you before I asked you.
I'll let you know everything I want to say.
Please, my master, the rich Capulet, and if you don't have Montagues's house, I beg you, by all means, to make my cup of wine for me
Keep up your merry-go-round!
And at the ancient feast of Sups of Capulet, where you once feasted with all the admirers of Veron, who's the man of
I'll see you off, and you can tell me, your face is a crow's, just like your nose.
Does my love really have a better price?
And neither did she see the all-seeing sun of Ne'er.
I'll go, but I'll leave you with your own splendor.
Duke, where is my daughter?
Call me on my way.
So I asked her to come with me to my maidenhead at twelve.
What, you damn fool?
When, who's calling now?
Take care of her.
Madam, here I am.
What do you mean?
You know, my daughter is pretty young, you know.
faith, I'm telling you, it's an hour.
She's not even fourteen years old.
I'll say it to my little girl, I only have four teeth left.
Even or a little weird, the whole year she's been a virgin, since the boy was born, in March
They're all set to leave on their way to Rome, for the rest of the Christians too!
So, in that case, Susan is with God.
She was too much for me.
And, by the way, on Christmas Eve she'll be fourteen.
Then she'll be.
I've seen it well, old friend.
I remember the earthquakes well, and I've never forgotten the tremors that shook the land.
I sit in the sun under a yard of holes, and have a lot of wormwood here in the house.
I saw you on the Tocoa, when the rabbit came to my house, and I heard it as a wormwood, and it tasted like sourness, because of the kind
The dovehouse bellowed "Welcome! "
I don't need you to help me.
Oh, " you're going to fall, don't you hear?
And, really, it's just a foolish fool, he's going to say "aye." Good morning, my
Oh, please, keep your peace, or I'll have you hanged!
Yes, madam, yes, madam.
But he smiled, I swear, a huge bump on his brow, a fatal blow, and cried, bitterly.
And you got your face, Mr. Hunt?
Your age will fall to the age of fall.
Oh, " Nurse, " " That's a hard word to say, " I pray you, "
God bless him with his grace!
You're the prettiest little girl I ever nursed.
I'll live, I'd like to ask you to get married, please.
Tell me, dear mistress, how do you feel now that you're going to marry this fellow?
That's a very good point, and I'm glad it's not mine.
Now, do it all in one thought.
You know, ladies who are respected, they already have mothers, so you're just insulting
I know you've been a maid to my mother in these years, and that you
And so you're looking for love for Paris.
A man, a woman!
There's no flower like Verona's summertime, that grows in a sunny
What do you think?
I look forward to getting better looking.
But since I'm your guardian angel, and since you're my guardian, I'll keep my eye on mine
Then I have to wait for the dust to settle.
Please go straight ahead, I beg you.
We'll follow you, madam.
Oh, girl, look, here comes a happy day.
What, is it our fault we're speaking?
Or will we pardon you?
The date's a little off-course.
But we'll measure them by what they think.
Give me some light.
I don't want to see that wistful walk again.
No, darling, let's have a dance.
Not me, I'm sure.
You're wearing dancing shoes with little legs.
I'm trapped in a lead soul.
You're a lover.
Get a cupid's wings and fly over the land.
I am too sore, bound by his chastity, and I'm not able to fly the feather.
I'm sinking under the weight of love.
We'll do it, choler.
I'm moving quickly, but I'm moving fast.
But you won't be moved quickly to attack.
Movement stirs and courage is courageous.
I'll stand in the middle of the street of the dog.
It's too much oppression to love someone, too much repression for something so tender.
Is love fragile?
It's too harsh, too rude, too brusque and a thorn in the side of good manners
Love is hard, love is hard.
The wanton thieves who steal hearts out of pity Tickle the sallow hearts
Come, boys, let's burn the daylight out of the sky, boys
No, I didn't say that.
Our lights are wasting away like the light of the day, like the old bulbs.
Well, let's go to the mask, but it's not what we're looking for.
Why, are you jealous?
I dreamed this night.
And so did I.
Oh, what did you have with your friend?
It's often the dreamers who lie.
I think they never dreamt of things they really meant when they sleep.
Then I'll bet that the Queen Mab was with you.
She galloped around on a horse once and dreamed of a nostril that smelled like her own blood.
Sometimes he gets a tithe-pig tail and tickles the priest's nose.
This is war, peace, peace, mercutius!
The wind that blows from you, we are not alone.
The dinner is done, and we'll be up early.
To, ladies, gentlemen.
Strike that drum, hit that drum.
Where is Potpan helping us not to take?
The whole body is filthy, and all hands must be clean, and there's a bad thing to do it.
Take off your tablecloths, leave the cups in your cups, take off your plates, and pour
Well, give me a piece of march-pipe, if you love me, but hate the idea of marrying a virgin, it'll be a feast.
Now, boy?
And in the great hall, in the hall of the gods, they call you, and they're seeking you, and
It's too dangerous there.
Ha, ha!
Take him to the lurch, quick, quick, for he is fainthearted.
Welcome, gentlemen!
I swear by my heart, this crust is for him.
I'm almost there, my lords.
That's right, my lady, thirty years.
More, more.
His son, sir, is a man.
His son is thirty-five years old.
Will you tell me?
I remember him very well, two years ago.
I won't, my lord.
Oh, how she has a great torch to light her fires!
I never saw a beauty until now.
This is Montague, by his voice, and he's supposed to be a brave man.
And that's why you're so much a storm?
Oh, uncle, it's Montague, our enemies, the same as the enemies we come here to ruin, a cunning rogue.
Young Robin?
That's the villain of this play.
And you want to be kind, little brother.
Leave him alone.
He says Verona brags about him as a young gentleman and tells me that he's a good boy, so to speak.
It would not hurt the wealth of this city in my house, where I live.
And stay put until he arrives.
Don't get scared.
You can't stand it!
Well, uncle, it's a shame.
To, to.
You're a naughty boy.
Is it true?
I know how this trick works.
You're against me.
Honey, let me speak to you, my heart!
Doesn't the tongue of the saints have no holy meaning?
Hmm, pilgrim, your lips must be used to deliver your prayers.
Oh, dear saint, give your lips what they do.
Prayers ; for God has mercy on us ; let it lead to despair.
Even though there's a grant of prayers, Saints don't move.
You can't move, but my prayers will affect you.
That's why my sin is all but out of my mouth.
Then my lips are sinning.
Have you heard about this sin in your lips?
My sin, I want you to be my one and only.
With your lips, you kiss this book.
Madam, your mother is waiting for you.
What is her mother's name?
I've taken care of her daughter, and now I'm talking to you.
I tell you, he has the chinks if he can hold her.
No, my good gentlemen, don't be afraid.
This little banquet is nothing but a small piece of silliness.
I'll rest here for a while.
We have our masters and our men.
It's all one.
I'm going to prove a tyrant.
The heads of the women?
And they watched the maids with their eyes, or with their ears, or with their tongues, or with their
What sense does that make?
That's what it feels like.
I'm known for being a pretty good-natured piece of meat, and they'll feel it when I can stand up straight.
You don't have a fish in your belly.
Pull the weapon!
I'm naked with my gun.
Come on, doctor, come on, nurse.
What man is that?
Son of Tiberio's son.
What's going on in the house now?
You know, I guess, you know, this is going to be a young Petruchio.
I don't know anything about it.
If he's married.
What's this?
What's the matter?
All the foreigners have left.
Now that she loves and loves him, it's only fair that he loves and loves her as well.
He loves her so much that she loves meeting her new love.
However, they have the power to overcome, but time means to find, time means to withstand the extreme sweet.
Will I advance when I'm right?
He's smart, and like my life is in bed with him.
I think he ran, jumping over the wall orchard.
Call and let me know what you got, dear lord.
No, I'll take it too!
Oh, how noble and sweet is that!
Oh, looks like you're breathing like a sigh!
Only one rhyme, and I'll do it well.
Now, a bit of gossip for my son, his cousin Abraham's daughter, to tell you when I get a little too ambitious.
If you hear him, anger him.
It must be anger.
I have to be honest with my invocation.
He loves love and is in a dark mood.
If love blinds the eye, love can never be killed.
That she would mock me like the maid who calls me the good ones, as she laughed alone.
Go, then, it's pointless to try to find it here.
The East is the sun, the sun shines in the East.
I've only worn this vestal to see fools wear it, and it's a sick green color
Put him down!
My lady, I have news for you.
It's love.
Oh, she must have known she was!
She talks, but she's not talking.
What about that?
She spoke of her eye discourses.
I don't think she's talking to me.
Her eyes twinkle with some business, which she can return to her home, so that she may shine in some of the best stars in heaven.
There will be such a bright light that birds will sing and think it's not a good night's work.
He holds his hand up in the same position.
Oh, I wish I had a glove to pinch that cheek!
O Romeo, do you know that?
What do you say is that man?
That's all there is to it, it's just your name.
So I won't have to be called "Romeo." anymore
What's your name, so my counsel goes, the worst in my office?
For a name I don't know how to say, for a name I don't
Don't you want to be called "Romeo"?
It's a big wall, steep and steep, and even the places of my kin, if they find you here, it's death.
Therefore, my kinsmen will not stop me from coming.
If they see you, they'll kill you.
And I'll prove that you're virtuous, and that they're hate-filled, because I'm proof that they
I won't stand for the world they've seen you here.
Their hatred ended my life, not death.
You know, the mask is on my face, and you know what I'm talking about tonight.
Are you in love?
I'll tell you, " yes, and " I'll take your word.
What oath do I have to take?
Don't swear, don't swear.
If you want, you can swear by the God of my idolatry, that I am, and am not, God
When my heart is truly nice, swear.
But today I'm happy to welcome you, but not with this contract.
In the autumn, when the sun is on its way, there will be a beautiful flower, a summer breeze, like a lovely flower, blooming there in the
Sweet rest and rest in your hearts, that is to say, your souls
Will you leave me so unsatisfied?
How do you want to get your satisfaction?
A promise of love for my love.
Before you asked for mine, I gave it to you.
Would you be better off if you did?
What's the meaning of love?
To be honest, and I'll tell you again.
But I wish I had something that would make me feel nice.
There's no limit to the sea, my love is vast.
I hear a noise.
Oh, sweet Montague, my dear, aha, dear Montague!
Stay, but don't become too chaste.
I'll come back.
Thanks.
I'm afeard, it's only a dream, too nice to be so many things to many people.
Three words, lovely Romeo, and I'll make you happy.
Don't worry about me.
Let's take our country's laws into our own hands.
Let's start.
When I pass by, I'll frown and let them pass.
No, they'll be brave.
I'll bite my thumb and it's a shame for them, because they've ruined me
Sir, are you biting our thumbs?
I bite my thumb, sir.
Are you going to bite us, sir?
You won't quarrel with me, then?
Hmmm?
No, my lord.
Tomorrow I'll send you my report.
Good night to you, sweet soul.
Till ten times worse to want your light.
My name is a small boy, and my ears are deaf, and my soul is a man, and I will call my boy "Romeo! " I'll cry out
How sweet, how soft, how strangely discordant, how their lovers' tongues like soft music for ears of the night, like
Romeo, go!
My nyas!
When will you be sent to the next time?
By nine o'clock.
I won't be defeated.
It's twenty years since then.
I've forgotten why I called you here.
I'll stand here until you remember.
And I'll stay here, so you can forget all the rest of your homes, as well.
It's almost time.
Still, the one that leaves him with a low little wisp like a prisoner on his filthy gyne, one that only he knows
If I were you, I'd be your bird.
Oh, well, I'd say so.
Still, I wish you were so kind as to give me a lot of love.
Good night, good night!
It's such a sweet sorrow that I'll say good-bye until the night is over.
Your eyes sleep when you sleep.
I wish I could sleep and rest and sleep.
And I'll be my ghostly nun's cell to my sickening friar, my help to feel good in the cold, sickening
The gray-eyed dawn smiles, and the east clouds glistening like drunkards at the last step of the day.
We must uproot the baleful weeds and precious-eyed lights of the sun, and the night dew will dry up the floor and wash out the
The earth is the mother, it is the tomb of nature.
Many in her womb and in her bosom are full of virtues, but none for others and all of them for each other.
Mickle is a powerful, beautiful, useful herb, plant, stone, and their true qualities.
There's nothing so vile that in the world there is no nobler good than to keep alive the truth.
That virtue itself is the vice, which is used to make things.
And poison seeps from the womb of the little flower, which is rich in medicine.
Two similar hostile rulers remain at home, in human and plant, as well as words.
Plants grow quickly where worms are dominant.
Good morning, father.
Benedicite!
What kind of sweet tongue do you want me to use?
Your head is made of a detached head, which you will soon call good, because you have an attached one,
Where the old man sleeps, care will watch him, and where he's been all this time, care will stay
And there's a golden sleep in the unformed brains of the young, stuffed with unkempt brains, filling the empty spaces between
My lord, this earliness is under some temperature.
But we've got him on our way to bed tonight, so it looks like we're on our way
The last is true.
I had your sweeter side, and yours was mine.
Is my father Rosalind's spirit?
That's my boy, sir?
Where am I now?
If you keep asking me, I'll swear by the Lord that I will.
Therefore, let us both be equally responsible for your help and the Holy Life.
I'm not the enemy, blessed men, I am not like that, so I'm not the enemy.
Only a jumbled confession can ever be forgiven.
I like the daughter of rich Capulet.
And we'll always be together, except that we need you to marry us.
I'll speak more about this when and where we met, how we met, how we loved it, and what we agreed to do.
My holy name, that's a big change!
And you gave up so quickly with Rosalind, who loved you so much?
Young men have eyes that look beyond their hearts, not at their own.
I still hear the old groans.
The old tears still linger on your cheeks, there.
You were the one who took on the sadness that's on you and yours.
Have you changed your mind?
So after me : Men don't trust women, so women can't be trusted.
I love Rosalind and am often criticized for liking her.
My schoolboy, your love has infected me, not your devotion, my student.
You told me to bury my love.
I didn't say you should change one love.
I beg you, please don't punish me.
The other girl doesn't like me.
She knew you really were in love with someone who didn't know what love meant.
Come on, you can't go, you can't go with me.
Let's go.
I'm overwhelmed with work.
Be careful and watchful.
They fall to the ground, they topple over and break their legs.
Where's my devil's Romeo?
Didn't he come home last night?
Not at the father's house.
I've asked for help from my servants.
Rosalind is going to torment him until he breaks down and cries, "Whore, whore, " and then turns into a black-
My lord, the letter has been sent to his father's house by Tybalt, the nephew of Capulet.
I'm sure it's a challenge.
Romeo, come answer the challenge to the arena.
Write to any man, and you can get any answer you like.
If the letter writer accepts the challenge, the governor will deliver a message to Rome that he will respond to it in kind, telling him if
Oh, sweet old Romeo!
Is he enough of a man to face Tybalt at this point?
What, what is Tybalt's story?
Has it arrived?
He's skinny like a dried fish without eggs, and he's not with his girl.
You're a fish, pale as a drop of water.
He's ready now.
Good morning, good morning.
Why did I trick you?
Sir, you've been lurching.
What I say can't be understood?
Well, the right.
Your employer is just like mine.
But he's not as good as I am.
Well, then, let's go.
You're lying!
Gregory, make your life a living hell with your silly antics.
What's that?
Get out of here, Brutus.
I'm losing the battle of wits.
Go on, keep going, or I'll give you the prize.
I know you're more of a prank to me than you are to you.
Did you chase that goose with you?
If you weren't here for me, you wouldn't have had anything.
I'll bite your ear out for that joke.
No, you won't bite me, good man.
This is the sour apple joke.
Your humor is made up of sauce.
Is it just the right meal for a little goose?
This is a satire that was made out of thickets that have been spreading out into a thin layer, like a yard of thick grass.
If you put "fat" on "gum" and "gum" on "fat" again, you're a fat
Why, isn't it better to laugh about love than to groan about it
You are sociable now.
You're now called Romeo.
You're wrong.
I think it'll be short.
The last part of this story is finished, and I have a plan to tell you nothing more.
Here's something nice!
And he's a woman and a man.
Peter!
I'll take care of you.
Let me have my fans, Peter.
Good morning, good gentlemen.
Good morning, sweet lady.
Oh, now it's afternoon?
I can't tell you later.
Run!
What kind of man are you?
I'm a man, my wife, for God's sake.
I swear, you're telling the truth.
He says he's going to get rid of himself.
Gentlemen, could you tell me where young Romeo is?
You'll be much older than me, young Romeo.
That's why it's a pity, because there are no more, worse, and that's why I'm the youngest of them all.
You're speaking very well.
What's the worst that could happen?
I think you took good care of it, very well.
He's a pimp!
I found out he's on his way here.
What did you find out?
Will you go to your father's for lunch?
Let's go there.
I'll follow you to the end.
He'll be more in a month than he'll be in a year.
I'll take him, even if he's stronger than me, and twenty men like him, if he says something against me.
If I can't, come on, somebody else will.
A dirty rat!
I'm not one of his pussies.
I can't carry a knife to his punk friends.
Nobody ever used you for kicks.
If I had seen anything like this, I would have pulled my gun.
I'm sure if I see a fight, the law will stand by its sword, I'll draw my sword as fast as any man, and let them know I
I swear, I'm shaking so much I can't speak.
That filthy scoundrel!
My lady, I greet you with my good doctor.
I swear to you, you are a good man, and I'll tell you.
My lord, my lord, she'll make a happy woman.
What will you say to her, madam nurse?
You're not paying attention to me.
You can confess your sins to the chapel of the priests of that chapel and get married.
Stay away from your doctor until he returns.
In an hour, you'll be given a rope ladder to hang yourself.
Goodbye, my dear.
Come on, tell me the truth and help me.
Farewell.
For your mistress, sing praise.
God be with you, good lady.
You can, my lord.
What do you have to say for yourself, good nurse?
Can your boy keep his mouth shut?
Did you ever hear, "Two can be put in the same basket"?
I know my man's true as steel.
Oh, mistress, are you the sweetest woman I've ever known?
I believe, Lord, that he was a little boy when he was a little girl, and there's a gentleman named Paris who wishes to take it on himself.
I sometimes begrudgingly acknowledge your faults because Paris is more beautiful than you are.
But when I say so, I swear that this sheet is as white as a sheet of paper.
Oh, nurse, what do you want to say?
This is a dog's name, you moron.
Thank your lady for the compliments.
Yes, I'll give you a thousand more times.
Peter, the Zork!
I'm ready.
By nine o'clock, I'm sending the nurse in.
Maybe she won't find it.
That's impossible.
Oh, he's slow, he's really slow.
A messenger like the sun should be thought of ten times faster than love itself.
She hasn't been back from the inn for three hours.
When she was young, she would have moved like a ball.
I'll love and be loved by you and his words will return to me.
They act like they're dead, sluggish, slow, fat, and pale.
Sweet Miss, tell us what news you bring us.
Have you spoken to him?
Let him go with your man.
Be patient.
Sweet nurse, what's so sad about you?
I smile even if the news is sad.
If the news is good, it ruins the good news.
Tired.
Please, don't disturb me.
Oh, my lord, my bones are beginning to crack under the pressure of my tiredness
I'd like to hear your bones and news of your future.
Wait a minute?
You don't feel breath, then?
You can't breath when you have enough air in your lungs.
The delay in the news is more than the news itself.
Is the news good or bad?
Answer this question.
I'll wait to find out what's good or bad.
I want to be happy with you.
What does it mean?
Well, you've made a fool of yourself.
You don't know how to pick a man.
Romano?
He's not much to talk about, and yet he has handsome, and graceful, and well-built feet and hands and feet, and he is not much to talk about with us, but he's got pretty good feet and hands and
He's not the nicest man alive, but he's gentle as a lamb.
Well, then, give me the advice you wish for, but do what you like
Good job.
Have you ever eaten lunch?
No, I never had lunch.
I knew you well enough to know all the things you told me
What do you think our marriage will be?
What do you mean by that?
I'm pounding my head.
I'm also in pain in my back.
I'm sorry, but I beg you to stop hurting yourself.
Sweet nurse, what did your love say to you?
You said you loved, as a gentleman, polite, kind, beautiful, and virtuous.
Where is my mother?
She's inside.
Where else would she be?
So strange of you to answer!
Love says, like a good gentleman, 'Where is your mother?
Are you impatient?
Oh, my good man, you're being silly!
Will my sore bones heal?
Now it's your turn to take care of your messages.
Your voice is so ragged, you make such a fuss.
Come, what did you say to him?
Are you allowed to go to confession today?
Me?
Go to Friar Lawrence's cell, then.
You'll find a husband waiting for you here.
Look at your face, my lord.
As soon as you hear any news, you're going to be as red as
Go to church.
When the night is over, your love will use him to reach the window and let him in.
Come on.
I'm going to lunch.
You have to go to the cell of the most renowned monk in the town.
I'm only trying to keep the peace.
Give me your sword or help me defeat him.
What's that?
I'm disgusted with the word peace, as I'm disgusted with the hell of you and the Montagues.
Come here, coward!
Be on your feet, use your clubs and spears.
We'll shoot them down!
Beat her senseless!
We hate capulets!
I hate Montagues!
What's that noise, what is that?
I'll grab my sword.
I was mad at old Montague.
Oh, Capulet, you knave!
You're not taking a step toward the enemy.
I wish I had a good time.
Thank you, sweet nurse.
Amen.
But this is no time to mourn, for my joy can't be destroyed by any thing.
In this case, moderation is a necessary condition for love.
It's a key to love for a long time.
It's like a fast way to do it.
There she is, lady in the back.
The rough road of life, just like her feet, will never be broken by her, just like her heart is like the light
That's what unreal pleasure is.
Both of us will thank you, girl.
I'll give him my care, so I'll take it.
If you wish to be happy with us, please tell us what you think we should be happy with in the wedding.
I don't speak of words, I think of more than I can.
We'll hurry, and get there safely.
Well, mercutio, call it a day.
I beg you, please don't ever use me!
Is that the man you like?
I think when you're in the mood, you're like a man in Italy.
And what about that?
It would be like two men, pretty soon there would be none of you left.
I'd fight a man in the beard if you had one.
You'll fight with a guy who's just like a nutcase for you.
You'd be looking for a fight like this all the time.
Your fight is full of head, like an egg with a yolk in it, but your whole body is full of fights.
A man tripped when he tripped over a dog on the street because he woke it up to eat some oats.
Have you never worn your old suits out in the wrong season?
So he tied a new pair of shoes with old laces already tied?
But you're saying that I need to be taught restraint, aren't you
If I were fighting you in the way you fight, my life insurance rates would be sky high.
Is your life insurance paid in full?
That's crazy.
Well, I'm sure the capulets will be here soon.
Well, then, I won't.
And with that, you'll have something else to do.
The word and curse will make it.
If you give me a reason, I'll get myself ready.
I don't have a reason to give you one without your help.
You're with Romeo, Mercutio.
Who are you, band members?
When we're seen like musicians, you can expect only noise.
We're talking about a public place.
Either you come to a rational conversation privately or, if you want to, you can join me
Everyone can see us out there.
So they could see, so they could be deceived.
I won't move to please anyone.
Well, maybe it'll be with you.
Here's my man, the man I seek.
He's not yours.
Tyrbalt, you're making me angry and having a reason to love you.
I'm not a villain.
So, good-bye.
I know who you are, and I assure you I don't know you.
I won't apologize for what you've done to me.
Draw your sword and turn.
If you love me as my name is supposed to, then you should rejoice in what I say, Capulet, which
The word is cowardly and vile.
What is your thing?
Pull the sword from its sheath?
Wait, or I'll have my sword out before you do.
I'll fight you.
Noble Mercutio, put away your sword.
Let's go, Tybalt.
I was injured.
Your household is afflicted with a plague.
I'm done.
Was his escape clean?
What's the matter?
But it's enough for us.
Where's the page?
Be brave, man.
The wound isn't as bad as you think.
No, it's no deeper than a well, or wider than a church door.
You'll find me tomorrow, and I'm sure you'll be well.
I think I'm finished here.
May your house be struck by a plague.
Oh, that dog, that rat, that mouse, that cat, that cat can scratch my back, scratch my nose,
Oh, the brat, the pickpocket-fighting brat!
Why are you here between us?
He's under your hand and I'm running.
It was a good thing to do.
Come on, Brutus, or I'll beat you up for it.
You're both in a plague!
They've made me like a worm.
Well, I'm done.
God damn your family!
Oh, noble Romeo, brave man of Mercutio!
Tybalt's back again.
He survived and he's dead, and mercutio is dead?
He must go with me or myself.
A poor boy, you went with him, and you stayed with him all this time.
Either the battle itself determines who's dead, or the death of
Romeo, leave us.
The citizens have come and hanged Tybalt.
Don't be surprised when they show you up.
If you catch him, he'll get the death penalty.
Well, now you have to leave!
Why are you standing still?
Who killed Mercutio, who's been stabbed in the back?
Tybalt, the murderer who fled?
It's lying in front of us.
I spoke to you, nephew.
When did you see this beginning?
Where's that bad guy who started this war?
I can tell you all about the terrible situation in which the noble prince has been left to die.
Her relative, brave Mercutius, was murdered and then she killed him.
Tyrbalt!
This is my brother's son.
Ha, ha!
Who started this brawl with Benedick?
Then, " woo me, " said Don Quixote.
Then he put his swords in front of them and slammed them down on their heads
I fell before I could even fall to the ground.
When Tybalt died, Romeo ran away.
This is the Montague family.
He's not telling the truth.
Twenty of them fought and only one was killed in this awful riot.
Come, Prince, I'll get justice for you.
Romeo killed Tybalta.
He must die at Rome.
I think he killed Tybalta with Romeo.
Who's paying for mercutius's death now?
The crime was committed to protect the life of Tybalt.
Your rivalry with me is very serious.
Therefore, you'll regret your actions so much that you'll be forced to forgive me.
I didn't hear your excuses or apologies.
You can't run away from this.
Do as I say, and take the corpse.
It's only a pardon for murderers that attracts more murderers.
But love blinds men, and it's best at night.
I wish I could go to sleep, so that I could fall asleep with my husband and have my virginity taken away.
Go to my face and take this blood.
Come on, honey.
Come, dear, come, Come, dear, Come here.
You have the same white as snow on your wings, and on the backs of your hands, as if
The night sky will be full of heavenly beings, the sun will burn and the world will fall in love with the night.
Did you hear him say to you to pick up the ladder?
Yes, yes, yes, the rope ladder is here.
What news is that, what news?
Why are you so upset?
He's dead.
We're ruined, ladies!
What a lousy day!
Is God so hostile and spiteful?
God hates Rome, but God doesn't hate it.
What devil are you doing?
It's as bad as hell.
Was that the suicide of Romeo?
Yes, that's the only word, and it'll make me worse than a snake with a bad eye.
Say "Yes" when he was killed.
I'll send my eyes to prison, and they'll never see anything.
I'll take my foul body back to the dirt.
Oh, Tybalt, he's my best friend.
I wish he were dead sooner rather than I have to.
Did Romeo die and Tybalt?
Tubal's my best friend.
Tybalt's dead, and it's been determined that, in the name of
Oh, God, did the love of this girl make him bleed with sorrow?
He did, he did.
May the day never happen again, but that day did.
A snake disguised as a rose.
Did the dragon hide out in some nice cave?
He's a raven, a raven with feathers on its beak.
What you've done to nature is beyond belief!
Isn't there a book with a beautiful cover like this one?
Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, I'm old.
Oh, my lord, I'm sorry!
I hope your tongue is covered with soreness.
He wasn't born to be ashamed.
He's only a piece of honor, full of honor.
I was a beast that he was angry with.
Did your cousin kill him?
Why did you kill my cousin?
My cousin will have killed my husband.
All this comforting news makes me feel better.
Why should I have to cry when I have no reason to?
It would be a pity to forget, but it would cause me to think about it like guilt was stuck in my mind.
But Tybalt's dead, and Romeo has been captured.
It's worse than murder a thousand Tylons.
If this were all, then Tybalt would have died.
My mother, " she told me, "Either by my father or by my father, or both.
I can hear them say, "They killed my father, my mother and Romeo and Juliet
This is the news of infinite death.
No words can express the pain that's been caused.
Where's my father and my mother?
They're weeping, they're weeping, they're weeping.
Will you join them?
I'll take you home.
Is it to wash away his wounds with his tears?
When their tears dry, I'll weep for the ruin of Romeo's life.
Grab a rope ladder and jump on it.
I've got my bed made, but it's a bed made for virgins and I'm dying.
I don't have to wear a ring on my finger, not that love
Go to your bedroom.
I'll go find Romeo and comfort him.
I know where he is.
Look, here comes your lover, Romeo.
I must go with him.
The Sheriff of Fowl hid him there.
Romeo, come on, I need to speak to you.
Come here, you're a scary man.
Father, what's the news, Mr. Jones?
You're too much of a victim to suffer.
The Prince has been punished, and I'm here to tell you about his punishment.
Is the Prince any worse than the end of the world?
Bless you, banishment?
Slavery is worse than death.
From now on, you'll be banished from Verona.
It's wide and deep, and it's huge.
I've got no world outside the walls of Verona, apart from the walls of Venice.
It's like being banished from the world, and then being thrown out of the world again.
Death is a death sentence like cutting my head off with a golden axe and smiling while I die.
Oh, Lord, what a fatal sin!
Oh, you filthy, hateful dog!
Torture, not mercy.
The lovers are more healthy and more honorable and more suitable for love.
She kissed her, but I ran out of town.
The flight is like a free man, but I'm being arrested.
But are you saying that exile isn't death?
And you, I couldn't kill you, no sharp knife, no dagger, no sword, no hand to disgrace me, except a banishment from heaven
Damn souls use the word exile to describe the damned.
They're just talking about a banishment.
Tell me, my friend, how to say banishment to me, a spirit discipline of men who forgive sins?
You idiot, listen to me.
Your servant fought your enemy before I was born.
I'll stab them with my sword.
The Prince came in, and the others fell, as we fought more and more people together.
Oh, where is that Romeo?
Did you see him today?
It's good he wasn't here to see this.
He followed me in, but hid behind the trees.
It was seen by many times in the morning, and his breath clouds with tears of tears that added to the morning dew and created a cloudy day, like the night before it
I'll tell you this sweet truth : when the sun rises in the east, my sad son is back in the east, just to escape
You can talk about the banishment.
Don't speak any more.
Oh, so deaf you are.
What should a fool be, if the wise man can't see?
I want to speak with you about your situation.
You can't talk about something you don't feel.
And if you were young, if you were in love with Juliet, if you had the grace and wit to turn the gentle girl into the bold one, if you were interested in her, if you loved her, if you loved her, if you had
Hurry up and get up!
Someone knocks.
Keep your head down, good brother.
If I can't hide from you, then I won't hide in the hope that everyone in my heart searches me with blinding panic.
Why are you angry?
Where are you from?
What do you want?
Oh, Lord, where's my lady?
Where is Romeo?
Oh, that's just like her, just like her.
Goodbye!
She lies on the ground and wails, crying, weeping and crying.
If you really are a man, stand up.
Good morning, good morning, good day, good morning, good day, good day.
What about such a deep moan?
My name is Doctor, nurse, and I'm here.
Oh, excuse me.
We all die eventually.
Did you ever speak of Juliet?
What's going on?
Where is she?
How are you?
What's the hidden woman's view of our lost love?
She calls me a murderer like I've killed my cousin.
What's your name on my body, monk?
Tell me, so I won't make it to your house tonight.
Are you a man?
You have a wild animal rage.
I remember you were amazing.
I swear by the holy order of God, I thought you were smarter and more rational than that.
Are you the man who killed Tybalta?
Why do you complain about birth, sky, and earth?
You have talent, but you're not using it for the best, not your body, not your love, not your soul, and it's a waste of
Get up, I'm tired of this!
You have a Juliet alive.
You killed Tybalt, but you've killed me.
Happy to be alive.
You'll enjoy the best of happiness.
You moan about your bad luck and your love, as troubled girls do.
When you've got your love, go with it.
Stay in the bedroom with her.
Call your lady, and tell her to hurry here, for there's a man standing
Romeo is here.
Dear lord, I would listen to great advice all night long.
Oh, educated people are amazing!
And tell my sweetheart to be ready to reprimand me if I do that.
I gave you this ring.
Get up, it's late.
Oh, it's just so much better!
Get off me now.
Farewell.
Leave before the night watchmen arrive or, at the very least, go to the next one after the day
Go to Mantua for a few days.
I'll be back here now, as it stands here, and, as it stands here, I'll find your servant and give him updates
Take it out of my hand.
It's past midnight.
Goodbye, good friends.
You did it so badly, sir, that we didn't have a chance to persuade your daughter to go with you.
She loved her cousin Tybalt.
I've already died before we could die.
I think these times are full of romance.
Madam, good lady.
And now, dear mother, I greet you with this daughter's greetings
I'll be right over there.
She's been away tonight and alone.
My lord, I'll make a desperate argument for the love of my baby.
Tell him how much my son Paris loves me.
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen,
My lord.
Tomorrow!
Ha!
Is it a good idea to rush?
It would be better to celebrate with a friend or two, rather than celebrate with such passion
I've heard it said that people think we don't care about Tybalt's memory when we're at a party, so if we're going to a great party, we don't care about his past
Then there will be about half a dozen friends at the marriage.
What are you doing on Thursday?
My lord, I'd like to say it's tomorrow.
Okay, let's go home.
It's Thursday!
Are you going?
We've only just begun.
That sound you heard was the Heaviest of birds, not the nightingale.
Look, my love, what's the light in the clouds in the east?
The night is over, the day is done.
It's not daylight, I know.
A meteor will shower down from the sun to Mantua.
You can stay for a little while longer.
You can't do that.
Bring me to you.
I'm going to die.
I'm happy, if you want me to be.
I want to stay longer than I have to.
Death, welcome, death, welcome!
Let's have a word.
This is not daylight.
It is, that's true.
That's the lark that sings like a snake, and it's very harsh.
He says the lark's a good night and a good day.
She doesn't really make us separate.
More light, make the room brighter.
Our pains grow more and more unbearable.
Excuse me, madam.
Medicine?
Your mother will come to see you.
The day is done.
Then the windows shut, and the world went out of its socket.
Farewell, farewell!
Let me kiss you and leave.
He sleeps in his bedroom, opens the window, and goes to bed in an artificial night.
My honorable uncle, what does he do?
I won't say anything more.
Did you ever do everything in your power to persuade him to tell you?
If you stick around, I hope you'll hear the real story.
You've gone, good lady?
I'll be old enough to see my Romeo come home, by this time.
Goodbye, sir!
I'll never miss an opportunity to send my love to you.
Well, will we ever meet again?
Oh, Lord, what a soul I am predicting wickedness!
You're too young to look like someone who's been dead for a long time
Either I'm not looking, or you're pale.
Your face looks pale too.
Our hearts are dyed with sorrow, and our colors go out
Farewell, farewell!
Good luck!
I hear everyone saying you can't make a decision.
I hope he returns soon.
Who's calling me?
Is my mother?
Why would she come here in such a strange way?
What's going on, madam?
Oh, my God, I'm not good.
Do you ever cry over your cousin's death?
Is he crying for you to wash his grave?
You can't bring him back alive.
Stop crying, and stop weeping.
A little sadness makes it feel like it's been made of love.
I'll cry for a big loss.
You'll feel the loss, but you won't feel anything.
I can't help crying like that.
You don't cry for his death as much as the fact that the villain murdered him.
What kind of villain, lady?
That's the villain, villain.
He was alive because the murderer is still alive.
Yes, madam, he's not in my reach.
No one can kill my cousin!
Stop crying.
I'll go find this rogue and bring him to Mantua.
Then I think you'll be well.
I'll never get a chance to see the man I loved until I see him again.
Madam, if you want a man to deliver the poison, I'll make it myself.
To marry my cousin and take her to the man who killed her.
Find out the way and find out the right man.
Now, little girl, I'm happy to announce to you that I'm well
This happy time is good for us.
Now, all right, let me tell you something.
You're a good father, you scoundrel.
Madam, how do you know this day?
Well, my dear, you have a husband whom I love dearly, who will make you a happy bride at the Catholic Church on Thursday morning, with good luck and good luck in store for you.
As I swore by Saint Peter's church and Peter too, I will not accept any favor from you.
What can I say to this husband before he goes to court?
Please pardon me, dear sister, but I won't be married.
I'll swear, when I'm married to you, it's not like Paris, but, like Romeo, it's just
That's wonderful news!
Come, your father is coming.
That's how you want to hear him, and see what he says.
What are you doing here, girl?
Some kind of stream?
Why are you still crying?
Did you tell her you made the decision?
Oh, I wish the fool were dead and married her!
How can I be so mean?
Isn't she proud of that match?
And she doesn't realize how foolish we found her husband?
But I'm glad you figured out what to do.
What's the matter?
What is this fuzzy logic that's leading me to this conclusion?
What's going on?
I hear you say "proud" and "thank you" and then "not proud." And then "Oh, "
You little thing, you're sickened by me!
You're worthless!
You're pale!
Forgive me.
What, are you insane?
Be patient, listen to me.
Don't say anything.
Wait!
Don't speak to me.
I hate her, a little slut!
For heaven's sake, let her name be "God bless her."
Sir, you shouldn't reprimand her like that.
Why, sweet lady?
Talk to your gossiping friends.
I didn't say anything bad.
God save you.
Shall I say something?
Quiet, you idiot!
We can't hear it.
You get angry too much.
Oh, damn it!
I'm angry.
My husband, the main thing was finding my husband, always my main focus at work, at home, at play, at play, at work, alone, in the
It's Thursday.
Please take my advice.
I wish you had a friend, if you're my daughter.
Think about it.
I won't break this promise.
Or a month or two.
When you can't delay, I'll put a wedding in the tomb of Tybalt.
No, don't talk to me, 'cause I won't say anything.
I can do what I want, but I won't worry about you.
Oh, my lord, how can you stop it?
My husband is alive and well and has my wedding day.
And how can I bring them back to earth if my husband won't send them back to me when he dies?
Please comfort me.
Are you feeling joy?
Good night, nurse.
A very good gentleman, man.
Romeo is just a big, dry cloth.
Madam, the eagle doesn't have the same green, quick and excellent eyes that make Paris so fastidious and careful
I'm sorry for my heart, but you should rejoice in the second marriage, because it's better than your first, which was a mistake.
Even if you're not marrying a better man, it's over.
Are you telling the truth from your heart?
Goodbye, Good Mr. Jordan!
What?
I've been given great comfort by you.
I was taken to the friar's cell at the Tower to repent and confess my sin, so I ended up at the Bottom of the Tower
Yes, that's right.
Oh, that's the most wicked demon!
Let me ask the priest for his help.
I have the power to live even if everything else fails.
On Thursday, madam?
It'll last a long time.
You're saying you don't know what the girl thinks.
I don't like it.
Now you know why the Emperor wanted to see you today.
Look, sir, here comes a lady.
Good to see you and my wife.
It may be, sir.
Hello, my dear, how are you doing?
And when does that start happen?
It's only a second ago.
And my father left this way so quickly?
That's not it.
I'm not the one who makes time fly.
Are you in love?
To the door.
In love?
So, where should I eat dinner?
You know, it's going to be on Thursday, love.
It's what he's going to be.
It is.
You confessed to your father.
If I answer, I'll confess to you.
Don't deny it, you love me.
I confess I love him very much.
I think you'll confess, I'm sure you like me.
I'll tell you more about that when I've got more to say about it than I have to say about you.
Poor soul, your face is crying.
You made me look like you.
Please forgive me, my daughter.
Oh, God forbid I should ever be prevented from performing the holy devotion!
I know your situation, Helena, and I've known about it from the very
I hear that you have to marry him on Thursday, and nothing can delay it.
If you don't tell me how to prevent it, you won't know how to prevent it.
If you could help me out, you'd be able to help me.
Wait, then?
Tuesdays.
Tomorrow night you will be alone.
Don't let the nurse stay behind with you.
Give me the vial.
Take it!
Love will give me strength and fortitude to do what I'm planning.
Goodbye, father.
You can't make a bad cook.
How does he look?
The ones who can't eat fingers are not hired.
Go away, get out of here.
We're unprepared for this wedding.
Yes, that's true.
When she came back from confession, she looked very happy.
I have to beg you to pardon me for your father's crimes, for I have committed them
Send the Count here.
Tell him about it.
I'll do the wedding tomorrow morning.
I heard the young man come to my cell.
Well, I thank you for it.
That's good.
Stand up.
Go ahead, and I'll say it again : all hail, you wicked fellow.
The friar owes us a great debt of gratitude, for our entire town owes him that debt before
Will you help me with my wardrobe and pick out my clothes and accessories tomorrow and make sure my jewels and the precious metals I'll need
No, no, until Thursday.
This is a lot of time.
Tomorrow we'll have our wedding at the church.
It's almost dark.
I promise you all will be well, I swear.
Come, dress Juliet in your own clothes.
I can't go to bed tonight.
Let me go and leave you alone.
Now I'll pretend to be a housewife again.
Yes, it's the best gown.
What, do you have something?
Will you help me?
I assume you have a lot of preparations for the festive celebrations.
Good night.
We don't know when we'll see each other again.
I'm desperate for a situation like this.
Now, here's the vial.
What if there's no luck in the mixture?
And will I get married tomorrow morning?
Sit down.
Look, look!
I'll meet the ghost of Tybalt once more.
Wait, Tybalt!
Romeo, Romeo, Come here, roome!
Here's some water.
I'll drink to you.
No, cousin, I'm crying.
Good man, why are you weeping?
Yes, that's love's job.
What else is love but the satisfaction of loving?
You're choking on sweet lozenges.
Goodbye, cousin.
Wait!
I'll go with you.
If you're not here, you do me a great wrong.
I don't have myself here.
I don't have any.
Really, who are you really in love with?
You would say I'd moan and tell you to shut up?
What do you want?
No.
But seriously, who is he?
Give the keys to the nurse.
They've called for the pie shop and the spice shop.
Keep up the good work, keep up the good work!
The other crowed and pounded.
The bell at the castle has rung off.
Don't worry about the cost.
You're an old woman, you whore.
Come on, honey.
I'll be sick tomorrow because you've been there all night.
I did many things to get rid of this disease, but I never got sick.
You were a woman's man for a while.
Oh, jealous woman!
Hey, mate, what's the matter?
All right, all right.
I'll find my own logs myself, without Peter's help.
Okay, and it's pretty good.
The man is amusing.
God, it's dark.
Wife, what a difficult thing this is!
What, what?
Welcome, nurse!
Go to bed, wake Juliet.
Go and dress her.
I'm off to Paris and will be there talking to her.
Come on, come on, come on!
The groom is here and is already married.
Please hurry, please hurry, please.
Mistress!
Welcome, mistress!
I bet she'll sleep quickly.
Hello, lady!
Good morning, sweet baby!
Welcome, ma'am!
Sweetheart, dear child!
Welcome, sweetheart!
What, you won't say a word?
And you will sleep with your beauty.
She's asleep, so she sounds as sound asleep as you.
Well, then, the count will go to bed and get you ready.
I know he'll wake you up.
Not him?
What's that noise?
Pardon me, but it's a sad day!
What's going on?
Look!
What a sad day!
Oh, God, Oh, good sir!
Now, my child, my reasons for life, wake up, look, or I'll die from this, which
I'll get right back to it, then.
Here comes his bridegroom.
She's dead.
On the day of curses!
Oh, it's too bad to be on this day!
She's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
No!
I'll see you later.
No!
It's cold.
She stopped her blood and her joints from rotting and gave them life again.
She's been dead for a long time.
She's dead like a flower frozen in time.
Sad day.
It's hard!
I'm choking and won't let her speak, which is the cause of death.
Is the bride ready to go to the altar?
She's ready to go, but she won't come back.
Death is my husband's son.
I have a son with death in his heart.
My daughter died of childbirth.
I'll die and everything will be over.
Everything dies, everything's dying.
And you, the one who waited so long to see me today, didn't see it?
Damn it!
It's the most miserable hour of the year!
Oh, but I have only had one child, one poor child, one poor child I loved, one child I've been comforted by, one child who died at the tender age
It hurts.
It's painful, it's painful, painful day!
Today is the blackest day of my life.
Oh, my lord, it's a very hard day.
She's been tricked, divorced, got cheated, got cheated, she was murdered!
She was brutally murdered by some cruel death.
Ah, darling!
Oh, dear, life!
I'm not alive, but my love is dead!
Despised, troubled, hated, murdered, their own!
Why are you doing this to me?
My soul and not my baby!
You've been dead for a long time!
Quiet, for shame!
That's not shouting and groaning to cure confusion.
He helped carry the little one in God's arms.
She's here now, and heaven is in her.
She's in a better place.
She's innocent, but heaven will help her to avoid her own death.
You wanted her to marry a rich man and get into the social hierarchy, so you would have liked her to go to heaven.
Are you crying now, even though she's over the clouds, and you're high above the sky?
I'm sure you love your baby, and you're crazy, but you're even crazier than that, because she's in heaven
If you want to marry and die young, marrying and dying young is the way to go.
Our solemn funerals will be held at our wedding.
Sad music will make the joyful music turn into mournful music.
Everyone wants to bury this beautiful corpse.
You won't disturb the heavens by trying to break their will.
Okay, let's go home and stop using the pipes.
Well, there may be a better solution.
No, sad music.
The time is not right.
You won't, are you?
No, I don't know.
So I give you everything.
What can we get for what we'll give you?
I swear I have no money.
You'll be a minstrel.
So I'll call you "servant.".
I'll cut off your head with this knife.
I'll sing it for you.
Do you hear me?
Go to him, and tell him the same way as men.
Well, sir, that silver sound is good.
Another studs-response, dear!
Well, sir, I'm not sure what to say.
I'll answer you, go get him.
They're not musical instruments, as such, as are instruments made of gold.
He's an annoying fool, isn't he?
Don't forget, Jack!
I'll soon have a pleasant news, and when I know my dreams are real, I'll quickly be cured
Oh, good lord!
I'm so happy to think of a woman I love when I'm happy to love her.
Tell me, is Veronna all right?
Do you have a priest's letter?
How is my wife?
Do you have my father's health?
How will this turn out for Juliet?
I'm asking for a second, 'cause nothing can happen if she's okay.
Well, that's good, and nothing's going to happen.
My soul is asleep in the capulet, the spirit of the capulet, the soul of angels,
I've been talking to you about the news of the day, and you're the one who told me about it.
I know you told me to, but you told me I should.
He wouldn't tell a sick man he was serious about his will.
I love you too, cousin.
So do I.
I love her with all my heart.
The fastest one to hit is a beautiful target.
Don't hit the target.
She's got it, and she wastes it like a badger.
I'm not worthy of heaven to give her despair.
Do what I say.
Don't think about her, she's too important to you.
Learn to forget my thoughts!
Believe it?
Then rebel against me, stars!
You know where I'm staying.
Draw a piece of paper and ink, and hire a horse to carry it around.
I'll go visit Verona today.
Please wait, sir, please.
This is the way you're going to hurt yourself.
You're wrong.
And leave me and you will do what I say.
Is there a letter from the Bishop?
No, my liege, not yet.
Whatever.
Hire your horses and come here.
I'll bring you to me immediately.
Well, I'll get you some sleep tonight, Juliet, and then I'll tell you all
Let's see how this turns out.
Men are so desperate that they quickly gain strength from the desperate thoughts of desperate
I remember that the house should be here right now.
Today is a holiday, so the beggar's house is closed.
Hey!
Oh, doctor, you've got a patient here!
Who's that calling for such a loud voice?
Come on, men.
I know you're poor.
Here's a $40 bill.
You're so poor, poor, and afraid to die that you refuse to do so
Your face is as thin as a thimble.
In my eyes, you're looking very hungry.
You don't have friends in the world, and neither do the laws.
There's no law in the world to make money out of you.
I think you're poor, not because you want me to buy it.
Lord, the friar is from St. Francis!
Brother, look!
He seems to be a friar John.
I'm glad to see you again.
What does this say about me?
If he writes a letter, give me the letter.
I can't go to Mantua because of this.
Then who can deliver the letter from Rosalind to her husband?
Sad news!
Come on, father, I'll go get him.
I'll go to my grave alone now.
Get him up early and wake him up at three o'clock.
I'll keep writing Mantua until Romeo arrives, but I'll keep her in my cell until then.
He's trapped in a tomb of a dead man!
Give me the light, my boy.
Get away from me and run away.
Turn the torch off, so I can't be seen.
I want to give you these flowers.
Just follow me.
Move.
The boy says someone is approaching.
Who would ruin my love rituals by dishonoring me?
Someone with a flashlight!
I'll have to hide in the dark for a while.
Give me my pickax and crowbar.
I'll go, sir, and don't bother me further.
That's the way to show my affection.
You have it here.
You can't mess with someone who needs help.
Go away and let me go.
You know who the ones who've died are.
Your heart's to fear.
Young man, don't get angry with me.
Oh, go away!
Stay out of here, you worthless hag.
You live, and you'll tell me to run from this madman with a ghost of a beard
I'll arrest you as a criminal.
Will you be my slave?
Go ahead, boy!
Oh, my lord, they're fighting!
I need to call the watch.
Come on, I'll go.
This is it, the noble Paris!
What did he say to my guy?
He told me he was planning to marry Juliet in Paris.
Wasn't he the one who told you this?
Or was it just a dream?
I'll bury you with a magnificent tomb.
Is this a grave?
No.
Light fills the room with her beauty.
But death has sucked your breath, but not destroyed your beauty.
You are not the enemy.
I can only tell you that someone has killed you, with your hand, the same hand that killed you.
Do you think he loves you and that he will keep you here to be his mistress forever?
Here, I'll stay in the hands of housemaids.
Oh, I'm staying here forever.
Look, here comes the last match!
Arm myself, bring me to the last embrace!
With all due respect to you, sir, he has a lot to do
And so I die.
And look at other beautiful women too.
Saint Francis, I'm in trouble!
I've been running from my old foot for years!
I'm a friend, a friend who's known you since before you were born.
Ha!
What's that light there, my friend?
It looks like Capulet is burning in his tomb.
Who?
Romeo, what is this?
How long have they been here?
Half an hour and a half.
We're coming to you with your body.
I can't do it, my lord.
Wait, then.
I'll go myself.
Oh, all of a sudden I'm scared.
I'm afraid something terrible has happened.
I dreamed that I was under the yew tree and that someone else was fighting and that my master killed him, because I fell asleep under it.
What's that bloody dirt that's stained the tomb?
Good morning, dear clergy!
Where's my husband?
I've been here a long time, and I'm well-versed in this place.
Where is that old man going?
Something moving in the background.
Ladies, let's walk out of the tomb.
It's been ruined by a greater power than we can control.
Come on, come on.
Your husband is dead, and you are also dead.
Come, put me among the nuns.
A cup, and I'm really happy with my true love?
He was poisoned.
Let me kiss your lips.
Maybe they're still full of poison, and they'll die with a kiss of medicine.
Is it rumbling?
Then do it quickly.
A knife, good.
My body and my spirit are rusting away, and I'm dying.
This is where it's at.
There's where the fire is.
The ground is as bloody as it is run-down, and everywhere you
Oh, this is horrible!
Go, tell the prince I'm sorry.
He went to the small group.
Get the Montagues out of here.
The search for others is common.
Right over there is my man, Romeo.
We found him buried here in the cemetery.
Let's keep him in custody until the prince arrives.
His eyes are trembling, his face is paling, and his breath is out
We took the pickax and shovel and carried them out to the graveyard as he walked out of it.
Very suspicious.
And don't forget the priest.
When it's morning, and I'm supposed to wake up early?
What do you mean, shouting so loud?
Here comes a crowd of people, crying "Romeo, " "Juliet, " "Paris, " and "God save the king." You
We're investigating how the murder was carried out.
Oh, my God!
Look how our daughter bleeds!
But in the same breast, where the Montague lies, the knife is in the sheath on the back of his breech
Ha!
It's like death warning, I'm old and I'm dying soon.
My lord, my wife's dead.
I've stopped her grief over the death of my son.
But what can I do for my old age?
You know, and you'll see what it is.
And then, you know, I'll have to suffer, and maybe help you out.
Be patient.
I'm the best, but I did the least.
I already have my reasons for apologizing.
Tell us what you know about this lawsuit.
I'll only tell you a short story so I can get away from all the boring stories that you've told me
So far I've told him to come here on the terrible night to help remove her from this grave when she falls asleep.
I know everything about it.
I've just received word that Juliet has died.
I have the letter for you.
Come on, brother Montague, give me your hand.
And what do you say to the offer?
I just repeat what I already said.
My daughter is only three.
She was only fourteen years old.
Girls younger than her are often married and happy to mother their children.
Girls are too young to marry yet.
But charm her, charming Paris, and she'll love you even more than she loves me.
My feast years have come and gone, and many of our festivities have been dedicated
I'll spend tonight with dazzling stars on the ground and the sky, and let you see them in my house tonight.
There's a new level of violence between two families in the beautiful city of Verona, where our story is being played out.
There are two unhappy families of the enemy that have fallen in love.
Their tragic deaths were the end of a feud between their parents.
Let's go with you.
Go find the names of the people listed?
It's written that the players and decorators have to play with the shoemakers and tailors, the photographers and fishers, the actors and their assistants.
I've been sent to find out who the people who've written their names on the list are, and I can't read it!
But there are two or three people here in a little while, and they'll be here soon.
When you're cutting your leg.
What's the matter?
Romeo, are you crazy?
I'm locked up and they're not eating.
God give me mercy, I'm whipped and tortured.
Please, sir, pardon my language, but can you read?
In my agony, I'm reading my own fortune.
You may have learned to live without books.
Do you know anything you've seen?
Yes, if I can speak and write the language.
I'll see you again I promise.
Okay, that's a halt, buddy.
Read the book.
And as for the mother of the Count of Anselme and his wife and daughters, Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters, Myselmy and his beautiful nieces, he will not be missed.
My great group of people, Sir Valentian and his cousin, Tybalt, I have at my disposal.
Where did you get all this?
And now he's gone.
Where?
To dinner?
We'll stay at our house.
Who lives here?
My master's house, sir.
Indeed, I wish I could ask you who he is.
Now I'm telling you, you won't have to ask.
My master is a big and rich king, and if you don't belong to the Montague family, please have a drink with me.
Goodbye, dear!
With every beautiful woman in Verona, they will attend the traditional dinner with Rosaline.
And you'll see a girl who looks at you objectively.
A woman more beautiful than I've ever seen?
It's been a while since anyone saw such a beautiful sun as this, since the world began.
I'm going with you.
Medicine, where's my daughter?
Tell him to come to me.
I swear to you, as a young virgin, I've already told her to come here.
Hurry up!
Who's calling now?
Your mother.
Mistress, here's something for you.
What should I do?
How young my daughter is now.
Yes, she's so young for an hour.
She was only fourteen years old.
I'll bet you fourteen ducats, but I'll have to tell you that I only have four teeth left
She'll be fourteen at the end of the year, and I'll get her, when Lammas Eve night falls
She was born the same day as the blessed mother of all Christians, and she is
Well, Susan's dead and with God.
I'd be happy for her.
On the night of the holiday, she'll turn fourteen.
Yes, I'll be right behind you.
Indeed, I remember it very well.
The earthquake was 11 years ago.
I put on my chest the bitter wormwood as I sat under the wall in the courtyard.
But when she tasted the bitter wormwood in my nipple, she was enraged, and began arguing with my breast as if it were a piece of leather.
The dome shook, and the earthquakes shook the earth.
I didn't have to say it to you.
Are you coming down with a face?
You're enough of that.
Please, quiet down.
Yes, ma'am.
I swear she cried, "Yes, sir, " and then, " Oh, sir, " and then she said, "Yes."
And when she saw me she cried bitterly, "Oh, I'm so painful!
Oh, " I said, "you fell in the face, " my husband
Then the nurse said, "Yes, sir, " and she began to cry.
God will choose you for his pardon.
I never nursed a prettier baby.
When you get married, my wishes will be fulfilled.
What are your feelings toward getting married, my daughter Juliet?
I'm honored to be here, but I'm not thinking about it.
Now, think about marriage.
There's a young woman in Verona, a mother, more like you than you are, and she's already a mother,
I was your mother from your age, and you were a virgin when I gave birth to you.
So, my good lord, I'm going to tell you right away : the brave Parisian wants you to be
What a nice fellow, girl.
There is no better man in Verona than him.
And doesn't it make no difference?
If what I see is admirable, I wish I could like him.
If you let me fall, I won't fall for this either.
Everything is a mess.
Follow me, be careful.
We'll follow you down.
Find a man who will take you to a happy end, one that will last forever.
What can we say?
Or would we have been forgiven if we didn't apologize?
Now it's time for fashion.
How they please us, they judge us.
Give me your flashlight.
I don't want to dance.
No, you should be dancing, Romeo.
Trust me, I'm not.
In dancing shoes, you wear nimble shoes.
And I'm a heavy soul made of lead, and it's stuck to my legs, preventing me from moving.
You're a lover and a friend to me.
Get Cupid's wings and fly.
He pierced me with his arrow too deeply, so I can't fly with him.
I'm the weight of love on my back.
We can't take their garbage.
I'm really angry when I'm angry.
So angry he could run away.
You can't stand up and fight.
I'll start shouting and then start pulling my hair out, just to be sure I'm angry
If you sink, and you jerk love in, you'll be dragged along with it
Is love really the thing that makes us happy?
I'm afraid it's too harsh, too harsh, too horrible, and it'll last as long as a thorn.
If love is strong enough, go, we'll go and let it go.
Light-hearted people make for good jokes.
Let's go, we'll waste the daylight.
Let's go!
We're not, but the night is near.
It's too hot out, and it's not good to go to the masquerade ball.
Why, did you say, "Why, I wonder"?
I remember thinking about it last night.
I did, too.
Well, what do you have for your dream?
I've often heard dreamers tell lies.
They lie in bed thinking about the truth when they should be thinking about their affairs.
So who was the Queen Mab?
I once saw a courtier trip over her lips, and he dreams of making money out of her.
Sometimes a priest's making up for all the wine he's drunk!
Come on, shut up, mercutio.
The wind whipping us off our path.
We'll have dinner at the end of the day, and it will be late.
Keep up the good work, lovers!
Take the drums and beat them.
Where's the potpan?
If only a few people had good manners, and even if they were filthy, they were unkind.
Take up the stool, the tables, the shelf, the cup, and go.
And, good friend, let me have some of Susan Grindstone, Nell, if you like it, too.
Yes, boy, I'm ready.
They want you in the great chamber.
Oh, we won't be there for a second time, both places!
Good afternoon, boys.
Let the one who lives the longest live, be quick and give him what he deserves.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Any man who is shy will have a lot of teeth.
Good morning, gentlemen.
I swear, it will run through to thirty years old.
It was only yesterday that I first heard about this, but it's been a long time.
Lucentio's son is older than him.
He was just thirty years old.
Tell me?
He was only a child a few years ago.
I don't know, my lord.
Oh, the fire of torches shows her!
I've never seen true beauty, then I'm lying.
This fellow is Montague.
Why are you angry?
My uncle, he's a Montague, a traitor.
Is this young boy's son?
He's the villain of the play.
Calm down, gentle cousin.
Leave him alone.
He's a gentleman, and a fine gentleman.
I won't insult him for all the wealth in this town, sir, for all the fame that's
Well, take it easy.
Just ignore him.
I won't tolerate him any longer.
We're being attacked, uncle, we're being assaulted.
Go on, go on, go on.
You're a little irksome little boy.
Is that how it?
I'll do what I must.
You contradict me, then?
I'll teach you something you can do.
Isn't that mouth of the saints and the pilgrims?
Yes, pilgrim, they're supposed to utter their prayers with their mouths.
Then, holy face, do what hands can do.
In my faith, I beg you to keep me from being broken.
Even if the Saints wanted to pray, they couldn't move.
Don't move until I make a prayer.
Now you're being spit on on my tongue.
Oh, now I've got your sin on my lips?
Sin in my mouth?
Return my sins, I want to forgive them!
You were like the scholar you studied how to kiss.
Madam, come to my chamber and have a word with your mother.
Who's her mother?
I was with my daughter just now.
The man who marries her will be rich.
No gentlemen, go to bed early.
Let's have a little snack.
You're right.
The fight is between the masters and the people who work for them.
This is all the same.
And their master will be harsh to me.
Are you cutting them off?
To cut off the head, the maidenhead, whatever.
Take my note in any way you like, and keep it in a safe place.
The women you raped will feel it.
I know I'm a good animal.
That's good that you're not a fish.
You pull out the tool.
I have my sword out.
Come on, sweetheart, come on, baby.
Who's that?
This is the son of a Tiberius.
Who goes out?
Well, I guess it's a young Petruchio.
I don't know his name.
I need to ask you something.
What is it?
What's the matter?
All the strangers have vanished.
But he should love his wife, whom he hates, and whom he hates himself.
Just as Julius loves her, so do I, and I have no reason to meet him.
Love has a power, but time is good for them, so they can meet with an intense pleasure in the extreme danger, in a place where they
Do you want me to go?
I'm sure he'll go home and sleep.
I saw him run across the garden wall orchard.
Tell him, mercutio, call me.
As if I were summoning a spirit.
Ha!
Your body shows it in front of your form, as if it were your own.
Say one rhyme and I'll rhyme it all right.
Just say "love" and "dove" and let the sound of your voice echo off the
If he hears you, he'll be angry.
I won't anger him.
I'm telling the truth and honestly.
It's not love, he loves in the dark.
Love doesn't go where it wants to go, when it's blind.
Let him sit in front of the gate.
If he's not going to be found, he won't be found.
The east, the sun, is Juliet.
Her virginity looks sick and green.
All right, let's go.
Hello, lady!
I'm in love with you.
I wish you could tell me how much I love her.
She speaks, but doesn't say anything.
So what?
She has some strange expression in her eyes.
She hasn't spoken to me.
On a business that would have taken her to the heavens, they would return from their world of business with a glass of wine in their hand, asking her to twirl her eyes,
And as she stared into the heavens, imagining the bright blue of the night sky, the birds began to sing, thinking she was the light of the day, she would come and
How she leans forward in her palm.
I wish I could grab his cheeks with my glove.
Ha!
Who's that?
And for my name, my name is your enemy.
Aren't you Signior Benedick?
You're not Montague, are you?
Tell me, how did you get in?
Why did you come here?
When you find out that I have a relative, you'll kill my relatives.
That's why your relatives are not a problem.
If they see you, they'll kill you.
Look, I'm invincible against hatred.
I'd give anything to keep you from seeing me.
If you had killed me, you'd have killed me to spite me.
Otherwise, I would blushes if you heard what I said last night.
Is it true that I'm a good man?
You'll say "Yes, " and I'll take it.
What do I have to do to swear by you?
No need to swear.
I swear by my beautiful self, if you have to swear by your beautiful self, by my sweet and innocent
Do you love your heart as I do, old friend?
But tonight, even if I'd like to see this exchange of vows, I don't like the exchange.
We'll meet again in the flower, like a beautiful flower in the summertime, and I'll tell you what to do about
I hope you'll find the same calm and rest I've been in my heart since I saw you in the forest.
Will you be satisfied with me?
What will you get out of tonight?
I've promised you my love before you asked for it.
Still, I wish you'd give me that promise.
Would you stay at the hotel?
Why would you do that, love?
I can only give it to you if you give it to me again
But what I have is mine.
You and my love are infinite in generosity and I have endless love for you.
I hear a noise.
Oh, Montague, it's true, oh, my lord.
Now wait a minute, and then let's go.
I'll come back and I'll be back.
Thank you.
Oh, it's just a dream, too kind of nice, for I'm afraid it's only
Romeo, three words, and it's good enough for me.
Don't be afraid, it's all right.
I won't start a fight.
Start something with them.
I frown, and they respond as they please when they pass by.
But it's not just about how they dare.
I'll bite my thumb.
Hello, are you biting your thumb?
I bite my thumb and scratch my head.
Are you biting your thumb?
Are you starting a fight?
Is it possible to start a fight?
No, sir, no, sir.
I'll send for the messenger tomorrow.
I'm going to rely on my own soul, good night.
You leave me a thousand times worse than I would ever leave you.
My soul, I wish you could call it My Name.
It's the color of lovers calling each other's names into the night, silver-green in the moonlight
Oh, noble rascal!
Do you have a baby hawk?
When will you send for a messenger tomorrow?
It's nine o'clock.
I won't fail.
But so far it seems like twenty years.
I've forgotten why I came back here.
I'll stand here until you come to your senses.
I'm forgetting that I'm not only staying here but also working.
It's almost morning.
I see a little bird coming toward him and he pulls a little bird from his hand and then yanks it in
I wish I could be your bird.
Sweetie, I'm thinking of you too.
But I would have killed you for too much.
Good night, good night.
I'll say good night until tomorrow night, until I feel sad again.
I hope you can be quiet for a while.
I wish I were asleep and could sleep with you, so that we could be with you more often
I'll ask my priest to be my guide, and I'll tell him about my luck.
The sun's path has fallen into a drunken, dark cloud.
Before the sun rises and the dew dries up, I'll have to pack up a basket full of poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers to hide from
It's just nature's tomb.
There are many different kinds of plants and animals, and the earth provides them with good nutrition from the womb.
They're masters in plants, stones and rocks.
On earth, which would be without any particular quality, there's nothing so evil as nothing on earth, which would not have the slightest chance of
When virtues are abused, the virtuous turn into vices.
There's poison and medicine in the weak plant.
Everything, even in men and in plants, has two sides.
Death soon kills bad as cancer.
Good morning, my lady.
God be with you.
Who's so eager to greet me at the gate?
You should be in bed now, boy.
And I think it's important for every man to have a concern, and to be always vigilant about it, but the young man shouldn't be
And then they should be up early and go to bed.
That's why I think you were upset by some anxiety this morning.
If that's not true, then it must be : you, my dear Romeo, didn't sleep.
Your last guess was correct, your answer.
A better rest than sleep.
With Rosalind?
That's good, my boy.
But where are you, little boy?
I'll tell you when you ask.
We have sacred powers to cure both of us.
I won't be afraid of hatred, holy man, only help my enemy, or else, I'll help
